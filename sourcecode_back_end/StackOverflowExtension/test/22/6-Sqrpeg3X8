Fabric is composed of many co-operative services that are under active development and need to be shipped quickly, reliably, and independently. But running in production is only half the story. This talk will introduce Fabric's Docker setup for development and testing. We'll discuss how we use containers to create lightweight development environments that start up quickly and stay in sync across teams. We'll share our methodology, what we've learned, and show off the Docker tools we've open-sourced that can make your development story even better.
