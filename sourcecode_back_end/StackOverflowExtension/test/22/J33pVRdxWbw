The first graphical user interface was developed by researchers at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) in 1973. Xerox's management did not understand the researchers' ideas, innovations and visions; and did nothing to make them into real life product. Steve Jobs visited PARC in 1979 and was impressed and influenced by the graphical user interface developed by researchers there, he walked away with a sackful of secret technologies; the very ideas that Xerox's managements didn't understand after years of persuasion by their researchers. Steve Jobs designed the new Apple Lisa in early 1980's based on the technology he saw at Xerox.
