It's the first game to sync across your Windows 8 PC, Surface, Xbox, and Windows Phone. So you can play the game on one platform, save your progress, and then resume your game on another, picking up where you left off. 

Another feature we're really excited to show off is asynchronous, or turn-based multiplayer battles across all the above supported platforms. You can challenge your friend to a battle, play your turn, then send it to your friend who then plays his move. It works with up to four players on any combination of supported devices.
