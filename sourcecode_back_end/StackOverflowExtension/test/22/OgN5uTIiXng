There's an app for that!
BIT's FingerTip app is easy to use like any other app. It can be used for instrument field support and System diagnostics. Using a wireless connection, the complete service information by instrument can be retrieved and remote instrument control via flexible scripts is possible.
The app provides the ability to connect to multiple instruments and to switch easily between them. It's easy to add scripts with iTunes.
