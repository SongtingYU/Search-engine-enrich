Today, visual inspections are an essential part of modern quality control. Automatic visual inspection combined with human control increases the reliability of quality assurance, especially in demanding tasks of surface testing. The APAS inspector is an assistance system for visual inspections. Equipped with a high-resolution, high-speed camera and innovative 3D mapping technologies and thanks to interchangeable testing modules, the station can be used in various production contexts â€“ like high-precision surface inspections or completeness testing.

With its quick-fixation casters the APAS inspector is applicable in a mobile way in production. There is no need for a steady fixation at the work place.
