Multitasktures is a jailbreak tweak for the iPhone that allows you to assign activator actions to the 4.3.1 Multi-Touch app switcher feature that Apple disabled in their latest firmware.

This is basically a hybrid solution to those of you who experience problems with enabling multitouch gestures on iOS 4.3.1. It's a decent solution, but personally I prefer the native functionality.

Remember this is iOS 4.3+ only.
