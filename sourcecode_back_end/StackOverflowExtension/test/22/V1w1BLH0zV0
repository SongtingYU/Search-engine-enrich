Light Table is a both useful and fun tool for photographers, designers, real-estate agents, and anyone else who loves working with collages of images. Import a bunch from your Photo Library, drag around and rotate them until they fit perfectly together. Then save a quick screenshot of the compilation before rearranging everything to try out your next creative idea. 
Hint: You take a screenshot at any time by pressing the Power and Home buttons simultaneously. The screenshot is then saved in your iPhone's or iPod touch's Photo Library as if you took a snapshot with your camera.
