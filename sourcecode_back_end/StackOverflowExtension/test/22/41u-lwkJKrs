Two applications I created for a multitouch table I am building. Both applications are still a work-in-progress.

Find more on DIY multitouch tables and applications at my blog sethsandler.com or www.nuigroup.com.

Thanks to Adi, Deej, and Muhneer for making these videos on their tables since mine is still in progress.
