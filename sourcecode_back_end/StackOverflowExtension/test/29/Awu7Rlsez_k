http://www.mimirsoft.com  This tutorial covers the most basic example of how to pull data from a database and display it in a list in your application.  We are pulling from a preloaded database(see tutorial 9) This is done by using a Cursor to hold the results of the query, which when then pass to the CursorAdapter object.  A CursorAdapter is just a little bit different from an ArrayAdapter.  We also use the ViewHolder technique in this video(see tutorials 7 and 8).
