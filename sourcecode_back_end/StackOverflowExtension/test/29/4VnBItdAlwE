This is a pretty cool typing game, free to play at http://www.pippinbarr.com/games/safetyinstructions/SafetyInstructions.html

The author of the game writes a description of it perfectly, so here it is from their website at http://www.pippinbarr.com/games/ where they have other neat games like this that they've made:

"Mavis Beacon Teaches Horrible Death In An Air Wreck! See if your fingers are fast enough to save yourself from the many grisly deaths available in the world of air travel. And learn something in the process! Like typing! And how to not die!

Safety Instructions was written in ActionScript 3 using Adobe's FlashBuilder 4.5 and the excellent Flixel library. It uses sound effects I made in bfxr and a soundtrack made with WolframTones. The font in Safety Instructions is Silkscreen by Jason Kottke."
