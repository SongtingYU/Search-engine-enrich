If you thought a game couldn't achieve so bad it's good status, you clearly haven't played House of the Dead 2. Typing of the Dead is an overhaul of the arcade/Dreamcast cult classic that trades the light gun for a keyboard. The literary critic in me says that it was done in an idealistic attempt to teach us that words can be just as powerful as guns. The realist in me says the conversion was done because Mario Teaches Typing was fucking rad, so why wouldn't this be?

Have fun with the worst voice acting in the history of video games.
