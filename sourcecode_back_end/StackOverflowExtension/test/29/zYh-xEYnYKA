Outlook has a good feature called Quick Parts, this allows you to have a pre-typed text block made from reusable pieces of content or other e-mail message parts that are stored in galleries. 

You can access and reuse the building blocks at any time. You can also save building blocks and distribute them with templates so that other users can use the building blocks you created.


To create a new quick part to use in outlook:

1) Type and then select the text that you want to add as a Quick Part.
2) On the Insert tab on the Ribbon press the “Quick Parts” button.
3) At the bottom of the menu that pops-up, select: “Save Selection to Quick Part Gallery…”


Once you have some quick parts built up in your gallery you can use them by:

1) Clicking where you want to insert a building block in the e-mail message.
2) Select the Insert tab then click Quick Parts.
3)Right-click in the gallery pane, and on the shortcut menu, click Organise and Delete.
4)If you know the name of the building block, click Name to sort by name.
5)Select the building block, and then click Insert.

As you see using quick parts in Microsoft Outlook can help you work smarter, rather than typing in the same thing over and over you can just click and have it prefilled.
