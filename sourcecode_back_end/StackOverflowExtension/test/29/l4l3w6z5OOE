How to use a Datatime in SQL.
The datetime is actually made up of two different pieces:
1) Date
2) Time
This can be demonstrated using the SQL Cast function on a string to convert it to a datetime.
Here is some SQL for the Date portion:
select cast('20121019' as datetime)

Here is some SQL for the Time portion:
select cast('10:05:00' as datetime)

Now, you can also simply use the built-in getdate() function to bring back the current system time.

select getdate()

And finally, I want to bring back a datetime from an actual table.
In this case, we will use the employee table from the SQL Training Online Simple DB:
select hire_date from employee

If we want to convert the result to a more formatted string, we will use the TSQL CONVERT function:

select convert(varchar,hire_date,104) 
from employee

In this example, we are converting from a datetime to a varchar (string).  The result will be in the format of 104.  

To translate 104 to a datetime format, you will want to look at the MSDN Documentation.
