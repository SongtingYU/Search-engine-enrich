I DO NOT OWN THIS SONG--ALL RIGHTS GO TO SPARKYS FLAW aka PARACHUTE!

Oh this is one small step I know 
But it's the last time I'll ever see you're face 
I'll go out on a limb and we'll hope it won't break 
It's just five words 

So I'm figuring out just what I need to say 
I'm writing it down and I'm getting it straight 
It's a double edge sword. It's a very first date. 
It can go both ways. 

What I had was tried and true 
But all I want is you 

So I'm trying hard not to fight it 
Light this fire and stand right beside it 
If I go down at least I'll go in flames 
I'll sing it out at the top of my lungs 
The choir is small but it sings a big song 
And If I go down at least you know my name. 

Oh this is one big step I know 
It might not mean much but I can't do much better 
I never thought it'd be so hard 
To say Hello. 

I caught a glimps and I never looked back 
I'll throw out the rope and we'll cut out the slack 
I'm keeping things tight and keeping things on track 
It's just five words 

What I had was tried and true 
But all I want is you 

So I'm trying hard not to fight it 
Light this fire and stand right beside it 
If I go down at least I'll go in flames 
I'll sing it out at the top of my lungs 
The choir is small but it sings a big song 
And If I go down at least you know my name. 

The choir is small but it sings a big song...
