One of the most powerful and basic strategies in problem solving is: (1) break a large, complicated problem into smaller, simpler pieces; (2) solve the smaller problems, and; (3) reassemble those small solutions into one large solution. Zeno of Elia (a Greek philosopher in the 400s BCE) posed stark thought experiments that go right to the heart of what can go wrong with this process. We continue to learn valuable lessons by studying Zeno's paradoxes.
