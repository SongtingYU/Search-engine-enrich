2015-12-20 This is a new type of hinge for Ikea Besta cabinets with the "push stop" mechanism. However, the screws are literally screwed up, no pun intended. Either the screws are too big or tilted or the holes are too small. So the best ramification is to use a screw driver, twist each screw a few times to make it smooth before drilling into the cabinets.
