Just a quick :-) video to show the gloves and quality of the leather, protection and lining along with the sizing of the gloves. They are tagged as  L / 10 but come up a bit tight and I'd say more like an 8" - 9" glove size. 

I've measured my hand in the movie and this is showing MY hand size.
If your hands measure smaller you should be OK as the gloves fit me fairly tight.

I'm 9 1/2 inches and 24 - 25 cm approximately and these are tight on my hand.

The colour just wouldn't pick up on the webcam and even on the photos I had a problem setting my Canon camera to pick out the lime green colour.
