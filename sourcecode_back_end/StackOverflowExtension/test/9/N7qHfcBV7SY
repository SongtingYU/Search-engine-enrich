lyrics:
We've been through this before
Compromise, leave me, agree right now
Useless cries, I'm telling you just how
Paralyzed, there's nothing I can do I realize
I liked the other you
You've changed, everything about you has changed
Look at yourself you've changed
With the facts in your face, it's causing conflict
You've changed, everything about you has changed
Look at yourself you've changed
With the facts in your face, it's causing conflict
Hypnotized, by all your complex games
Sacrifice, my own opinions change
Justify, just why I stay with you
I can't see why, nothing else for me to do
It makes no sense, putting myself through all this
At my expense, don't I deserve much less?
Its way past time, to right the wrong we're in
The bottom line, always, you think you win
You've changed, everything about you has changed
Look at yourself you've changed
With the facts in your face, it's causing conflict
You've changed, everything about you has changed
Look at yourself you've changed
With the facts in your face, it's causing conflict
You brought on all this mess (who are you?)
My needs were not addressed (for I'm so)
You cause so much distress (so stressing)
This much you must admit
You brought on all this mess (who are you?)
My needs were not addressed (for I'm so)
You cause so much distress (so stressing)
This much you must admit
You've changed, everything about you has changed
Look at yourself you've changed
With the facts in your face, it's causing conflict
You've changed, everything about you has changed
Look at yourself you've changed
With the facts in your face, it's causing conflict
I'm not the one who changed
I'm not the one who changed
