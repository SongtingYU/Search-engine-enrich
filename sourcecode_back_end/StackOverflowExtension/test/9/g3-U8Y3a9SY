BENAND™ is an SLC NAND flash solution with embedded error correction code (ECC), which removes the burden of ECC from the host processor. Use of the common NAND interface allows BENAND™ to maintain compatibility with general SLC NAND flash in terms of the command set, device operation, packaging, pin configuration, etc. Therefore, the latest BENAND™ can easily be used as a replacement for a general SLC NAND flash without being concerned about a system's error correction capability.
