Sadhguru explains that a leader is one who can see or do something that others cannot. A leader is someone whose sense of identity should be beyond himself. He is willing to think, feel and act for more people than just themselves.

Vinita Bali: I couldn’t agree with you more (Sadhguru Laughs). So, I want to explore two or three other dimensions that you spoke about. You spoke about capacity, you spoke about leadership. So, talk to us a little bit about what you see as, what are… Who are leaders and what is leadership? Is there a difference, is it…? Who’s a leader and what is leadership?

Sadhguru: I know there’s a lot of talk about leadership and wanting to become leaders. I don’t think anybody should try to become a leader, it’s quite obscene that “I want to become a leader” – that means all of you should be what? I don’t know. I know what you would like to call yourself (Laughs). It’s not about you wanting to become a leader or someone want to be… wanting to become a leader. Because of a certain thing that you have done within yourself or a certain level of observation or a certain intelligence or a certain experience, you are able to see something that most people are not able to see. The moment you are able to see something, then people will naturally look up to you as a leader because you are seeing something that they cannot see. And if you become a leader, there are many ways to become a leader – you can get elected, you can get selected, you can work it, you can pull other people down and become a leader or simply people will rise you as a leader because they see that either you are able to see something or you are able to do something, which they themselves cannot do. I feel this is the way leadership should happen – if you want to call it that – that someone is able to see something and do something that others cannot do, so everybody wishes he must take charge of the situation because naturally, he will be able to do something that the others will not be able to do.
