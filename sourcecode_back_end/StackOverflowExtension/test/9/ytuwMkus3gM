i wish i was witty
well, wittier
i wish i was wise and i wish the percentage
of times i’m right about things
went from 95 to 100
because really, i’m right a lot of the time
but i would like to be right
all of the time.
i wish i could sing better
people tell me i can sing
but i wish i could sing the best 
i wish belting on a west end stage
came as naturally to me
as mumbling does.
i wish i was the best
at everything, really
i wish i could talk on the phone without choking
and i wish i could talk to people in person
also without choking.
i wish my feet didn’t smell so bad
and that i didn’t cry in public
as often as i do.
i wish i didn’t get so jealous
and i wish i could stop thinking
that the people laughing near me
are laughing about me.
i wish i could stop cracking my fingers
not because i want to stop
but because it grosses everyone out.
i wish i was more flexible
in terms of both touching my toes
and changing plans
i wish i didn’t think about
eating the way i do
i wish i could have a slice of pizza
at a party without hating myself.
i wish i was patient, less stubborn
and brave
i wish i was more interesting
but that might be one of those things where
everyone else thinks i’m interesting
but i don’t because i’m me
and i know i spend most of my days
wearing pajamas in my room,
which isn’t that interesting.
i’m not even saying that to be cute and quirky, 
i am just genuinely undressed
in my room most of the time.
i wish i was actually as mysterious
as everyone who doesn’t know me thinks i am.
i wish i didn’t feel like
i had to be the best at everything
i wish i could give myself the freedom
to make a mistake without thinking about
the mistake for an entire week after the mistake.
i wish i wasn’t so hard on myself.
maybe i should stop looking for things
i don’t like about me now
