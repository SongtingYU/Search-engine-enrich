Letra:
And when i feel like i'm the victim
i will come running home to you
and i will weep like i will change
when i come running home to you

i make you believe that i'm a changed girl
that i'm honest good and pure
then i'll drag you through my shit again
'cos i know you'll love me more

i love how your world adores my gutter mind
this reflection says it all
so now i will let you go my baby
let you fall

and all of your rosy scarred up wrist binds
make me crucify you more
with all of your blood encrusted small finds
kiss restraint and it's just cause

so see the survivor in control now
i'm the whore you knew i was
look at the changed girl good and pure
on tracy's floor

i'll come running
i'll come running
i'll come running right back to you
