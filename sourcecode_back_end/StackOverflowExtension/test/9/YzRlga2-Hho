We are nearly at 100,000 subscribers! Thank you so much! Every year I set a goal for myself. In 2014 it was to win my Gaelic Football teams "Most Improved Player Award" and last year it was to learn how to animate. It's important to set goals for yourself and give yourself something to be proud of, but I couldn't have done this without your support!

Thank you to my Patreon supporters: Zoltan Gramantik, Josh Levent, Adam Flohr and darth patron.
