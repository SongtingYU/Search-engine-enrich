Get Cain and Abel from http://www.oxid.it/cain.html
THIS ^^^^^^^ IS THE ORIGINAL SITE!  DO NOT TRUST THIS DOWNLOAD UNLESS IT IS FROM THIS ORIGINAL SITE!

Cain and Abel is NOT a virus, I repeat, it is NOT a virus!  It WILL come up as a virus because it is capable of doing many "virus-like" things, like sniffing passwords...so your anti-virus almost certainly WILL say that "this is a virus", but if you download from the ORIGINAL site as I posted here, it is NOT going to hurt your computer!

Any questions, feel free to leave a comment or message me...
