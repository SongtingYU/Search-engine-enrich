As you all may now, Microsoft pushed the new driver stack in Windows 8.1 so ALL (not only USB 3.0) devices must provide a BOS descriptor. Sony ADB and Fastboot doesn't, so Windows fails to enumerate the device which is reported in Device Manager as error code 43.

This also may help if you have a USB drive or mouse and it stopped working after you upgraded from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1.
