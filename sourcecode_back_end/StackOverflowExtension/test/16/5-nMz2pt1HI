When i am trying to delete the Microsoft Folder in the 'Program Data'. I am getting 'Folder Access Denied' Window. You need permission to perform this action. You require permission from SYSTEM to make changes to this folder.
Solution:  Delete all the usernames or groups, including SYSTEM from the security tab. Change owner as your computer user account. Also, replace owner on subcontainers and objects. Enable inheritance and then try deleting the folder. This time you can delete the folder without the error 'Folder Access Denied'. If the folder is used by any other programs, then you will get the message 'Folder In Use' The action can't be completed because the folder or a file in it is open in another program. For such cases,  close the folder or file and try again.
