A quick overview for students in my online class: higher order functions are functions that take and return values which happen to be functions. In order to sort things in Python you need to know about key-functions which you pass to the builtin sorted - but you might also check out map, filter, reduce, min, max and so on. You can also use functional closures to produce custom functions from functions - and understanding this concept can lead to all sorts of interesting techniques.
