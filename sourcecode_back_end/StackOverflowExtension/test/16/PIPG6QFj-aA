The lecture covers the concept of nominal/categorical variables in a regression model. The video explains the concept of Dummy Variables to code in various levels in a categorical variable and use them as independent variables in a regression model.
The lecture demonstrates how to use one hot encoding to create dummy variables in SAS and include them as independent variables in a linear regression model using PROC REG procedure.
An understanding of basic statistics including hypothesis testing, variable distributions, P value interpretation is a must to grasp the concepts discusses in this series. Please refer to the Basic Statistics lecture series - http://goo.gl/BqhMqs  in order to cover these topics from ground up.
