If you ever try to remove a Windows folder from an old hard drive you might get this error message "You Require permission from TrustedInstaller to make changes to this folder".

The actual fix is at the 3:50 mark, but you can watch the whole video and see what I did to troubleshoot the TrustedInstaller Error.
