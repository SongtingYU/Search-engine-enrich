Absorption costing, which is required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), includes all variable and fixed production costs in the calculation of product cost. Variable costing, which is used to supplement managerial decision making, includes only variable production costs. Long term, a business must recover its fixed production costs. However, including these costs in product cost analysis can lead to incorrect conclusions. For example, a product might have variable costs of $4 and fixed costs of $1. If the producer is approached to sell additional units at a discount price of $4.50, and there will be no increase in fixed costs, it may make sense to do so. If the producer accepts this offer, overall profit will increase by $0.50 for each additional unit sold.
