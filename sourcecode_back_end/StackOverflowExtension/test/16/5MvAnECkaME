Looking for a fast track to comprehensive education on the Electric Universe? Those most eager to learn are invited to the EU Workshop, November 14-16, 2014 at the Sheraton Phoenix Downtown. This event will be led by Wal Thornhill and Dave Talbott, who are preparing full summaries of their life's work, something that has never been presented publicly. Wal's talks will be complemented by additional material from electrical theorist Dr. Donald Scott, and Dave's presentations will be reinforced by Ev Cochrane, author of several essential books on the ancient sky. Seating will be limited. Check out: https://www.thunderbolts.info/wp/2014/06/19/eu-workshop-home-page/

The message has been loud and clear for many yearsâ€”a community of scientists insisting that human activity is warming our planet, taking humanity to the edge of a precipice. But now, as science begins to understand earth's place in the electric solar system, the meaning of the present warming plateau becomes clearer. The Earth-Sun connection, together with the Sun's galactic environment, can help to explain climate extremes of every kind. Today, new voices and new perspectives are bridging the theoretical gaps, and independent investigations have reached some startling conclusions. No one can know the future, but some of the electrical changes in our solar system could point to catastrophic change on the horizon.

Ben Davidson is the researcher behind the Suspicious0bserver channel on YouTube, a channel that has rocketed in only 2 years to over 28 million views with 2 million added a month. Ben was classically trained in law and legal research, before taking up independent research in diverse sciences. His online presence has been a constant source of data dissemination, inspiring public interest in a variety of scientific fields, including the 'electric universe' theories. Ben focuses on the daily solar environment and the electromagnetic interactions between the sun, earth, and the galaxy. It was this interdisciplinary "due diligence" that led him to the surprising conclusions he will present at the conference.
