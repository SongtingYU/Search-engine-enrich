Look at the [subprocess module][1] in the stdlib:

    from subprocess import call
    call([&quot;ls&quot;, &quot;-l&quot;])

The advantage of subprocess vs system is that it is more flexible (you can get the stdout, stderr, the &quot;real&quot; status code, better error handling, etc...). I think os.system is deprecated, too, or will be:

For quick/dirty/one time scripts, `os.system` is enough, though.
