When an exception occurs in a WCF service, the service serializes the exception into a SOAP fault, and then sends the SOAP fault to the client.

By default unhandled exception details are not included in SOAP faults that are propagated to client applications for security reasons. Instead a generic SOAP fault is returned to the client.

For debugging purpose, if you want to include exception details in SOAP faults, enable IncludeExceptionDetailInFaults setting. This can be done in 2 ways as shown below.
1. In the config file using service behavior configuration
[behaviors]
  [serviceBehaviors]
    [behavior name="inculdeExceptionDetails"]
      [serviceDebug includeExceptionDetailInFaults="true"/]
    [/behavior]
  [/serviceBehaviors]
[/behaviors]

2. In code using ServiceBehavior attribute
[ServiceBehavior(IncludeExceptionDetailInFaults=true)]
public class CalculatorService : ICalculatorService
{
    public int Divide(int Numerator, int Denominator)
    {
        return Numerator / Denominator;
    }
}
