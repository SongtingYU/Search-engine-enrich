In this lesson we're going to look at code that causes exceptions, and strategies on how to fix them. These are common Java exceptions. It's not the list of all common exceptions though. I'm focusing this video on exceptions in the java.lang package.

The exceptions are: 
ArithmeticException
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
ClassCastException
ClassNotFoundException
CloneNotSupportedException
IllegalArgumentException
NullPointerException
NumberFormatException
NoClassDefFoundError
UnsupportedClassVersionError
