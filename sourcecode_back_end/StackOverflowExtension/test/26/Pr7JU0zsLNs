Here is a song I created to help my 6th grade students study. I hope you enjoy.

Straight up, now tell me do you really want to separate a mixture
Oh, oh, oh
Or is it just a solution
(mixtures separate, they separate)

Mixtures Separating
The particles will settle again, decantation
Or is it filtration
Cause liquids pass right through the filter, no solids
Another is heating
Evaporation, distillation
Spinning centrifuging
It's separating a suspension
Well then

Let me see all the substances in mixtures
Broken all in parts two or more
Choose a method on what's in the mixture
And on the physical, the properties
Separating mixtures
Broken into parts of two or more
Choose a method on what's in the mixture
And on the physical, the properties

Place it in jars or settling
Decantation is separating
Insoluble particles and solids sink
Separate from liquids and then we drain
Would you look at that, a filter grabbin' stuff
Pouring mixture in it, trappin particles
Man that residue filter snatchin' it in
Filtration separating liquids from solids
Another method, things dissolved
Evaporation soluble solids from a solvent
Solutions heated till the liquid's a vapor evaporates
From the heating solids left behind there, but
Need a way to obtain pure solvent
Taken from solution distillation's the way
Boiling liquids, evaporated steam
Condensates, to a new place

Centrifuging happens in a cool machine
Spinning quickly in the block, man it's keen
They be separating solid particles
From suspensions spinning circles
Spins real fast centrifuge it goes
The solid particles
Are forced to the outside
Cause centrifuge's spinning more
Man the liquid can be poured off
Filtered off, yeah filtered off 
A useful tool, analyze what's in it
Know what's on my mind, yeah, chromatography is tight
Yeah right it's tight
Movin' slow cause dissolved in solution
Piece of paper shows travel of substance
Scientists identify they compare to get right
Get right

Straight up now tell me do you really want to separate a mixture
Oh, oh, oh
Or is it just a solution

Straight up I tell ya I just really want to separate a mixture
Oh, oh, oh
Come on is it just a liquid, son 
(mixtures separate, they separate)
