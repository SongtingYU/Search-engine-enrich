ASP.NET is a development framework for building web pages and web sites with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and server scripting.

ASP.NET supports three different development models:
Web Pages, MVC (Model View Controller), and Web Forms:

Web Pages Tutorial

If you are new to ASP.NET, Web Pages is the perfect place to start.

Web Pages is the easiest development model for developing ASP.NET web sites.

In our Web Pages tutorial you will learn how to combine HTML, CSS, JavaScript and server code, using the latest Razor server markup syntax with Visual Basic or C#.

You will also learn how to extend your web pages with programmable Web Helpers, including database, video, graphics, social networking and much more.

Web Forms is the traditional ASP.NET model, based on event driven Web Forms and post backs.

Over the years, developers have used ASP.NET Web Forms to create many of the largest websites in the world.

If you want to study the design model used by many web developers over the last 10 years, this is the place to start.

Who Are These Tutorials For?

The tutorials above are for anyone who wants to learn to build websites on the Microsoft ASP.NET platform, from hobby-related sites, to new, modern, and fully commercial webs.

Even if you are new to web programming, you should be able to follow the tutorials, but it will help if you have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.

It will also help if you have a basic understanding of scripting languages like JavaScript or VB (Visual Basic).

Do you have a preference for VB over C#? Do you want to learn both languages? The good news are: In the W3Schools tutorials most code examples are in both languages.

If you are a professional web developer with prior ASP.NET experience, you can still learn a lot, since these tutorials covers a lot of new ASP.NET concepts, like HTML5, CSS3, JQuery, and more.
