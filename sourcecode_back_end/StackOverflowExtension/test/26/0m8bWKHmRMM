Chromatography. Animation (IQOG-CSIC)
Chromatography is a technique for separating mixtures of products, widely used in the organic chemistry lab. It is based on the principle of selective retention, whose objective is to separate the different components of a mixture.In chromatographic techniques always a mobile phase consisting of a fluid (gas or liquid) which carries the sample through a stationary phase which is a solid or liquid on affixed solid support. The components of the mixture interact differently with the stationary phase. Thus, the components pass through the stationary phase at different speeds and are separated. Also used as product purification technique.
