Here is a short clip of CSX pulling tanks on the "Lafayette Pass" after separating a long string and leaving some south of Wabash Avenue. This takes place on a siding on the CSX mainline. I didn't catch the crew doing the whole separation, but it looked as though they were occupying both tracks north of Wabash Avenue to do more switching.
