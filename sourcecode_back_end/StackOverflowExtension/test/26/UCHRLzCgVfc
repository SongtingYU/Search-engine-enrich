This tutorial will cover use of the try-catch-finally code block as well as use of the "throws" keyword. You can find the Java exceptions as a list here: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Exception.html . Note that some of the listed exceptions have subclasses that are exceptions as well (e.g. RuntimeException). Thanks for watching! :D
