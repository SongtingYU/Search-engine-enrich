Here is a video i made using EKA and some simple household ingredients. I am removing the oil from water in this video by creating a barrier that allowed water to pass but not oil. It uses the same technique as hay or peat moss or a polymer treated cloth. I would like people who might want to work together with me to email me at EKALOGIC@gmail.com
