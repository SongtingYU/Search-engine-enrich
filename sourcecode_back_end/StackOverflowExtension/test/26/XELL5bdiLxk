Whether it is a Null Exception or any other type of error, it first comes at catch (Exception ex).

We can handle multiple Exceptions inside this catch (Exception ex).

Suppose we are expecting NullReferenceException and DivideByZeroException in a try Block.

Here we check whether the type of error is NullReferenceException or DivideByZeroException.
