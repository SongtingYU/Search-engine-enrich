My front load washer doesn't spin. What is going on with it?

It was just tired of being taken for a ride.

I’m serious. If it doesn’t spin, it doesn’t clean.

Check to see if the thing was interrupted in the middle of a load. Some units won’t go unless you put it back on start.

No, it didn’t run from the start.

Check to see that you hit the start button. Some of them don’t go unless you tell it to go.

It isn’t like an elevator button. I’ve pushed the button several times.

Check the control panel for an error message.

This is a washer, not a computer.

Some washers are so smart that they give you error messages as cryptic as a Windows PC.

The thing isn’t giving me a specific error message.

Then maybe it is human error. Make sure the door is closed.

It is. And it seems to be latched.

Then it might not think it is shut.

You’d think this was an open and shut case. How could a smart washer be so dumb?

You’d be surprised how many smart washers to save water and electricity error out on stupid stuff?

Then the problem might be the control panel.

Especially if it is corroded due to water.

It’s a washer.

There are dishwashers that corroded because the steam vent was right under the control panel, and the same thing can happen with a clothes washer.

No wonder they say steam cleaning is not worth the trouble.

It’s trouble with the dry cleaner bill, and it is trouble with the repair bill on the clothes washer.

Repairmen are worse than dry cleaner people. They at least tell you payment as they hand you clean clothes, not complain noisily until you’ve paid the appliance guy.
