The center of Kiev has become something of a battlefield over the past few days. This is Independence Square, known as Maidan, which is the main hub of the protests - that's where the opposition camp is. But some of the most-fierce clashes on Wednesday broke out on this nearby street. Tires were set alight there - and you just heard RT's Peter Oliver reporting from the scene. Two people were killed - both reportedly with bullet wounds. The authorities, however, say police on the streets do not have live ammunition. And there do appear to have been vigilantes with firearms among the protesters, as you can see in this picture. Let's talk more on what's happening in Ukraine, with Daniel McAdams - head of the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity.
