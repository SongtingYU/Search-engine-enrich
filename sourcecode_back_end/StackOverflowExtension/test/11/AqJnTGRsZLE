Hoping to keep his mind off Mikay and fulfill his promise to his mother, Dasho Jao plans to preoccupy himself with work. Mikay, on the other hand, finds herself torn between Dasho Jao and Gino. To make matters worse, Mikay loses her job as Ashi Behati accuses her of trying to lure Dasho Jao for his money. Meanwhile, Alicia's concern for her son Gino pushes her to head to Vicky's house, where she unexpectedly runs into the woman that Ashi Behati has been looking for.
