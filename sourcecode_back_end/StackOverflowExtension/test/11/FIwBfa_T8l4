There are many free data recovery programs  to recover your accidentally deleted files from pen drive,  External HDD, SD cards, etc.

I have done research on various data recovery software to find the best one for the visitors of this channel. Following parameters were examined to find out the best tool that do this  job

Ease of data recovery on USB, External HDD, SD card.
Compatibility of these software for various file types for data recovery.

After research, I narrowed down to two tools that work well for data recovery from USB flash drive, external HDD or SD card. This tutorial demonstrates the use of  two software, namely 
1. Testdisk & Photorec
2. Glary undelete.


While both the software work well, If you encounter a problem where your important file has got accidentally deleted from external storage and now you want that file back, then for most of the cases Testdisk & photorec should help solve the issue. 

 If I am asked to put a rank to them, then Testdisk & photorec  scores over Glary undelete. It is a CUI-based program but it is just as easy to use as a GUI-based program.

Some of features of the software are:
• File size is small 
• Supports FAT, NTFS, NTFS + EFS file systems
• Supports recover compressed, fragmented and encrypted files on NTFS
• Undelete files on removable devices
• Simple and User friendly interface
• Command user interface
• Testdisk changes the name of the recovered file, while in case of Glary undelete, files name does not change.

Note: This software will work on windows, MAC & Linux. These steps can be performed with pen drive, External HDD or SD card.
