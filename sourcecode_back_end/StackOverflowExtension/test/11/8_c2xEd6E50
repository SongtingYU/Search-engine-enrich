In the video I show how to fix the rather cryptic switch error. All you have to do to is to power the equipment off and then set every single switch in neutral postition. Some say it's annoying, some have found methods to get rid of it by modifying the mainboard of the transmitter, but I personally think it's a feature that improves safety - you can't switch it on without making sure all the functions are set to zero. So you simply won't accidentally start the plane with some mixes like airbrakes/flaps enabled or D/R expo settings you don't expect. I know one should check that before start, but it just makes sure you do every single time.
