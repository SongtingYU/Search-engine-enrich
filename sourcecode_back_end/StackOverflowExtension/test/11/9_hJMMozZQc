Windows 10:
"It’s the Windows you know, only better.
Familiar and better than ever

Windows 10 is familiar and easy to use, with lots of similarities to Windows 7 including the Start menu. It starts up and resumes fast, has more built-in security to help keep you safe, and is designed to work with software and hardware you already have.

This combines the strengths of Windows 8 with Windows 7.
Millions of people are already using Windows 10

The Windows Insider Program is a global community of fans who love Windows and want to help make it better. Insiders see the operating system in its earliest stages, and play a role in shaping it. Their feedback has contributed to the best Windows ever.

Make the web work the way you do
Microsoft Edge lets you move quickly from browsing to doing. Write or type notes directly on webpages and share them with others, read online articles free of distraction, and save your favorite reads for convenient access later.

Multi-doing helps you get to “done” faster
Get to done faster by better managing your desktop. Snap up to four things on one screen at the same time and create virtual desktops whenever you need more space or want to group things by project, like Office apps for work and games for play.

Flexibility to work how you want
The new Windows Store is the one place for all your favorites

Introducing the new Windows Store, a unified shopping experience across every Windows 10 device. Browse the store on your PC, tablet, or phone and easily download great free and paid digital content including apps, games, music, movies, and TV shows.

Great built-in apps that work across your devices
Windows 10 comes with great built-in apps4 like Maps, Photos, Mail & Calendar, Music, Movies & TV. And these apps use OneDrive to back up your information and sync seamlessly across your Windows 10 devices, so you’re never far from what you need.

You literally are the password
Any device can carry your content, but only Windows gives you a truly personal experience. With Windows Hello, your device authenticates and recognizes you based on your presence, providing extra security, convenience, and even a friendly hello."
