Learn how to download torrents anonymously and use utorrent anonymously with a VPN or proxy service.

We show you exactly what we mean by the term "anonymous" vs not anonymous when downloading torrents. The truth is that your torrent IP address is easily viewable by all peers sharing the same torrent as you. That's we recommend that all Bittorrent users use an anonymous VPN or proxy service (or both would be better)

In this video, we use Private Internet Access VPN (VPNTopten.com's editors choice 2014 best torrent VPN)
