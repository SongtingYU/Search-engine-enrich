There are two binary files are included: one of them is "native" application for Windows 7 and second one is native for Windows 8.



Usage:

ele - runs   new console window in the current directory.


ele /x - runs   new console window in the current directory and closes the originating console window. If ELE started from a file manager,
it just opens a new elevated console in current directory.


ele application.exe /param1 /param2 - runs elevated instance of the application.exe with param1 and param2,
e.g. ele notepad.exe d:\myfile.txt


Advices:

 
�Put ele.exe in any folder what included in your %PATH% environment. E.g. C:\Windows is very good choice.


�You can add ELE on toolbar of Total Commander to open current directory with elevated Administrator's rights.


�Also you integrate ELE with Windows Explorer. Sample registry files are included.
