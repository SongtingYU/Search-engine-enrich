Demolition at Fukushima being done in a manner that can only make things worse. Not sure what they are thinking but it appears that Tepco knows alot more than they are saying and without a doubt the elected and appointed members of the  US government are hiding the facts from the People they are sworn to serve and protect. Where is bold and independent investigative reporting?  I call on our President, Congress, the NRC, State Govenors, and all Leaders to give the American People the true facts, and to act now in our national intrest to preserve the lives of us and our posterity!
