The excellent Lightworks NLE is very picky on what video formats to import. EyeFrame Converter can convert most video files to the Lightworks friendly Matrox Mpeg2 I-Frame HD format. If this format is too heavy for your computer, use the convert to proxies option, which will produce low quality clips for a smooth editing process, which later can be swapped with high quality intermediate files for high quality export.
