Using an additional state variable, such as an index variable (which you would normally use in languages such as C or PHP), is considered non-pythonic.

The better option is to use the built-in function [`enumerate()`][1], available in both Python 2 and 3:

    for idx, val in enumerate(ints):
        print(idx, val)
