`super()` lets you avoid referring to the base class explicitly, which can be nice. But the main advantage comes with multiple inheritance, where all sorts of [fun stuff][1] can happen. See the [standard docs on super][2] if you haven&#39;t already.

Note that the syntax changed in Python 3.0: you can just say `super().__init__()` instead of `super(ChildB, self).__init__()` which IMO is quite a bit nicer.
