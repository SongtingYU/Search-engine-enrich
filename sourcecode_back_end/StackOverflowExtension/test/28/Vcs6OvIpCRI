Hey guys! Here is a Vlog of my Art Print process. I Filmed this over two days to give you an insight of how I go about things when I ship out my art print orders. It was a bit of a race against time as I had to prep and pack everything and get it all posted out to my customers in the morning before I flew back to Spain on the 2nd day. I work best under pressure though ;) This video also gives me a chance to reflect on certain pieces and hopefully answer a few questions you may have about how and why I do what I do. Hope you enjoy it and don't forget to subscribe and hit that thumbs up! 
Let me know if you would like to see me do more Vlogging and if so what you would like to see! 
Much love Chris x

P.s. Apologies for some of the dodgy editing. I was learning a new program while on an aeroplane and found I couldn't tweak certain parts without screwing up larger parts of the vid. So theres lots of gum chewing and silly face closeups!
