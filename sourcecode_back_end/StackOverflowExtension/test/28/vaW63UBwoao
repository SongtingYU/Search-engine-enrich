I demonstrate my cheap DIY screen printing setup.  I made it for less than $100 (with my power washer included).  I can also print bottles, glasses or any cylindrical unit with my DIY cylinder screen printing arm.  It's called "Da Arm".   You can't get a better, cheaper system than this.. Da Arm will never be defeated (lol) as it only cost $15 and does just as good a job as a $10,000 bottle printing machine.
