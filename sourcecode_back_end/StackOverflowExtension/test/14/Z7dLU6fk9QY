'Look Up' is a lesson taught to us through a love story, in a world where we continue to find ways to make it easier for us to connect with one another, but always results in us spending more time alone.

I don't want you to stop using social media or smartphones. 
It's about finding a balance. It's about making sure you are awake, alive and living life in the moment; instead of living your life through a screen.

Written, Performed & Directed by Gary Turk.
