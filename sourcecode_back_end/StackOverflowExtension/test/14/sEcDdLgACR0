The Keio Short-Term Japanese Studies Program (KJSP) is a two-week intensive program for students who wish to study in Japan. The program offers a variety of courses broadly related to Japanese politics, economy, business, arts, and traditional and modern culture in addition to on-site activities where students can see and experience the things they learned in the classroom only hours before.

Participants will gain knowledge not only from the lectures by experienced faculty members and through a range of activities, but also through exchanges with current Japanese Keio University students who will also join the program. 

Moreover, students have a chance to learn "Survival Japanese" targeted towardã€€first-time Japanese learners. Providing students with short but intensive learning opportunities about Japan, this program is best suited for undergraduate or graduate-level students who are first-time students in Japan. We invite you to experience this exciting educational  opportunity at Keio University this spring.

*This is a pilot program. We plan to establish a comprehensive short-term program in the coming summer.
