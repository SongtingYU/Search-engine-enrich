In this short video I explain the legal term&nbsp;similar health provider. &nbsp;That term has a specific meaning&nbsp;in a Connecticut medical malpractice case. &nbsp;In Connecticut you cannot bring a medical malpractice case unless you have a certification from a similar health provider that there is reasonable cause to believe that malpractice has occurred. &nbsp;The term &quot;similar health provider&quot; is defined in the statutes. &nbsp;You must have the right type of doctor review the case. &nbsp;I explain that in this video.
