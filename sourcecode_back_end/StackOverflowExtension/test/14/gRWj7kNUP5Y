In this series of lectures, I will briefly introduce some results concerning the geometry inspired by the pluricanonical system |mK| of threefolds of general type. I will talk about the general method to estimate the lower bound of the canonical volume K^3 and the proof of a 3-dimensional Noether's inequality. In the last part, I will discuss some new examples of canonically fibered varieties of general type. The titles of the four lectures are as follows:

1. A review on the geometry of |mK|

2. Lower bound for the volume K^3

3. A Noether type of inequality and its variant

4. Some new examples of canonically fibered varieties of general type.

The lecture was held within the framework of the Junior Hausdorff Trimester Program Algebraic Geometry. (11.3.2014)
