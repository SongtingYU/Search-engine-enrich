This shoe lacing tutorial is of "Straight Bar Lacing", so named because it results in straight horizontal bars with no underlying diagonals, which looks neater plus relieves pressure on the top ridge of the foot. The shoelaces run straight across on the outside of the shoe and straight up on the inside.

Works best on shoes with an even number of eyelet pairs. There are various workarounds for shoes with an odd number of eyelet pairs.
