NASA has called an urgent press conference on Monday the 26th of September, when the space agency will announce a breakthrough on Jupiter's moon Europa.

NASA has been analyzing data from its Hubble Space Telescope which is currently prowling the universe.

Astronomers will present results from a unique Europa observing campaign that resulted in surprising evidence of activity that may be related to the presence of a subsurface ocean on Europa.

Most scientists agree that where there is water, it massively increases the chances of finding life.

NASA called a similar emergency press conference when they announced the discovery of flowing water on Mars.

It was only last year that Alfred McEwen, professor of planetary geology at the University of Arizona, and his team found evidence of water on Mars, and even found that water was still flowing on the surface.

Since then, efforts to find life on the Red Planet have been intense.
