Since establishing his Downunder Horsemanship Method, clinician Clinton Anderson has redefined the approach to correcting problem horses. Communicating with horses in a language they understand, Clinton earns respect in a safe and efficient manner, eliminating dangerous and unwanted behavior. With the Method, gone are the days of forcing the horse to submit and "cowboying up." What makes Clinton's approach so successful is he not only fixes the horse, but he gives the owner the knowledge, tools and confidence to be a leader their horse trusts and respects, which builds the foundation for a safe and enjoyable partnership.
