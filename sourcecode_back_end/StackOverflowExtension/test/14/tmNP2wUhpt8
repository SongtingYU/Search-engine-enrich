How to Treat Diabetes Mellitus

The primary aim of treatment is to keep blood sugar close to normal and prevent blood sugar from escalating into the 'danger' (life-threatening) zone. It is discussed below:

1) Healthy Diet : Keeping an eye on the diet is crucial to manage diabetes in the right way. Shunning away from sugary foods like cakes, pastries and bakery products is a prerequisite to manage diabetes. Eating fruits and vegetables everyday can go a long way in keeping health in optimal condition. Also, simple carbohydrates transform into sugar at a faster rate than complex carbohydrates. Some of the good sources of complex carbohydrates that can be included in the diet are whole wheat bread, brown rice, oats and barley.

The focus should be more on eating green vegetables (in the form of salads) and less on fatty foods like poultry products and red meat. Too much fat in the diet can make the body cells more resistant towards insulin activity, which can aggravate diabetes. When preparing meals avoid frying and prefer healthy cooking options such as steaming, boiling and grilling.

*** Important Tip! Amongst fruits, you need to include jamun (syzygium cumin) in your diet as its displays anti-diabetic properties. Intake of jamuns daily will ensure better control over blood sugar levels. Extracts made from jamun seeds and leaves of the tree may also help in controlling diabetes.

*** Dietary Tip! As far as vegetables are concerned, patients should not particularly miss eating asparagus. One study reported in the British Journal of Nutrition indicates that daily consumption of asparagus can be effective in managing diabetes effectively. Asparagus appears to increase secretion of insulin as well as reduce insulin resistance, which works to control blood sugar.

*** Fenugreek Seeds. Fenugreek seeds display anti-diabetic properties as found out through several clinical studies. It is found to be beneficial in reducing blood sugar levels in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Add a spoonful of fenugreek seeds in a glass of water and let it remain overnight. In the morning, have the water along with the fenugreek seeds. Practice this daily to keep your blood sugar levels under control. Fenugreek seeds inhibit absorption of sugar as well as increase the production of insulin, which assists to keep blood sugar in check.

2) Exercise : It is said that diabetes has a negative impact on quality of life. Well, this might be true for those patients who prefer a sedentary lifestyle. With no or little exercise, sooner or later diabetes is bound to raise its 'ugly head'. It is observed that in order to carry out any physical activity, the body requires energy which it derives from sugar. Thus, through exercises like walking and cycling everyday for 30-40 minutes, one can burn sugar briskly, in turn helping to control diabetes.

3) Oral Diabetes Medicines : For type 2 diabetes, oral medications that make the body more receptive to insulin, are prescribed. In some cases, the patient is advised to take insulin injections along with oral medications to control blood sugar effectively.

4) Insulin Therapy : People affected with type 1 diabetes (insulin deficiency) are given insulin through injections. Basically, this therapy helps to increase insulin levels, necessary to regulate blood sugar. The number of injections per day will depend on how severe the diabetes is.
