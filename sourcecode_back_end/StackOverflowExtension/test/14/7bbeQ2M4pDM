This video shows a resin bound gravel driveway project completed in 4 days.

The existing driveway was excavated, an anti weed membrane was laid, followed by Mot Type 1 sub base was on top. Edge detail in the form of Granite Setts were then installed. Once that was done, a porous base macadam layer was laid, and finally our Stonex resin bound gravel was trowel applied by hand to get the perfect finished drieway surface.

Stonex Resin Bound Stone is the ideal choice for driveways.  We have many different types of aggregate available to choose from, in different sizes, which are mixed on site with resin and applied to a suitable base. Available in porous or non porous format, depending on the site characteristics, the former  allows surface water to drain to the subsoil, as it would do naturally. Low maintenance, easy to clean and UV stable means colours won't fade over time. Added to that it's slip resistant and  chemical resistant so won't be damaged by petrol/diesel or oil leakage and is easily cleaned with a jet washer.
