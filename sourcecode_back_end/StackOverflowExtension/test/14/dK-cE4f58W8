In this video you will learn how to solve an integer programming problem using Gomory's All I.P.P method. Initially we apply simplex method and see if we could obtain a integer solution. In case,we don't get integer solution we generate and introduce Gomory contraint in the simplex table and the problem using dual simplex method.
