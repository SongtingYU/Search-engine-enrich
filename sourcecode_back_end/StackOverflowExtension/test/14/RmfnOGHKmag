Mike Huckabee has decided to weigh in on Jay Z and Beyoncé 's marriage (because that's a totally normal thing for a 59-year-old conservative white politician to do, right?). The former Governor of Arkansas has released a new book appropriately titled "God, Guns, Grits and Gravy" and, in addition to discussing topics such as gay marriage and airport security, he also shares his, um, insight into the power couple's relationship. In an excerpt from his book posted by U.S. News & World Report on Thursday, Huckabee writes, Beyonce is a "terrific dancer – without the explicit moves best left for the privacy of her bedroom. Jay-Z is a very shrewd businessman, but I wonder: Does it occur to him that he is arguably crossing the line from husband to pimp by exploiting his wife as a sex object?" Yes, that is a real excerpt from Huckabee's book, and unsurprisingly, many are calling his comments both racist and sexist.
