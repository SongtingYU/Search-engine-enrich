Stock Market For Beginners | Investing In Stocks

Warren Buffet makes it sound easy but you cant deny that he knows how to invest his money.

What I love about this interview he talks about how he has left money on the table by selling too soon. Goes to show that even Warren and his collegues can never tell the outcomes of stocks, but the reason they are so successful is they invest for the long term.

At 0:40 he explains what they focus on
At 0:53 he answers how stocks come to his attention
At 1:16 looking at price first vs. looking at the business of the company
At 2:20 Would you ever buy stock basedon political pressure

It's a short clip, bute getting a small peek into Warren Buffets mindset when it comes to investing is a great value to anyone interesting in investing.
