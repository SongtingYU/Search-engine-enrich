Former Arkansas Governor and one-time Fox News host Mike Huckabee is currently promoting his new outrageously titled book, God, Guns, Grits, and Gravy, in which he makes some really idiotic remarks about Jay Z and Beyoncé's Grammy performance of "Drunk in Love" last year.

It's obvious that the failed presidential candidate doesn't have a clue what he's talking about—it's her song, Jay is simply a guest feature, among other inaccuracies. These outlandish and unwarranted remarks are just a taste of Huckabee's book, which happens to feature chapters like "Bend Over and Take It Like a Prisoner." In related news, watch a video below of Mike Huckabee playing shitty music on a guitar.
