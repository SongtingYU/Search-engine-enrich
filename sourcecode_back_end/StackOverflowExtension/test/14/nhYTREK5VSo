Description:
The practice of torture involves making a person suffer through long periods of time. Before you start on a rampage saying that humans can be really cruel to each other, there were different reasons to torture besides purposely trying to inflict pain. Today, torture is mainly used as an attempt to try to get information, usually involving some form of terrorism. Dating back to even before the medieval times, torture was often used as a form of punishment, and the goal wasn’t always to kill the victim, but instead injure them just enough so that their punishment and scars would send a message to people.
Some of the most shocking methods include the Tiger Bench. It would involve the victim being tied upright to a bench, and bricks would be added to the victim’s feet, elevating their legs while still being bound. Eventually, the legs would break at the time. The Tucker Telephone was a homemade box made from a telephone that could electrocute people. This practice was often used in prisons to reel in disorderly prisoners. The victim is usually tied to a chair, with one wire on the victim’s toe, and the other wire, the “hot” wire, was placed on their genitals, literally shocking and burning their privates and damaging their organs. 
The most well-known torture method is waterboarding, where the victim is laying down with a cloth on their face while water gets poured to simulate drowning. The victim usually would go crazy, drown, or have lung damage. This practice dates back to medieval times and is still used today.
Because torture has become a controversial subject, more psychologically based methods have been developed, such as the White Room. The victim is placed in a sensory deprivation room that is completely white, and they are only fed white rice. Eventually, after 15 minutes, the victim will start having hallucinations and seeing things and hearing sounds that don’t exist. This method of torture usually caused the victim to go completely mad. Another psychological torture method is sleep deprivation. The victim is forced to stay awake for several days on end. Now, when the body doesn’t get any sleep, they start hallucinating and there have been accounts of people going into a complete psychosis. Which is worse in your opinion? Physical or psychological torture?
Since we keep talking about medieval times, they implemented torture methods such as the Rack, which involved tying each limb to a wooden frame, which would move apart. This was considered to be one of the most painful methods of torture as it would not only dislocate each limb, but eventually tear the limbs off the victim. And let’s not forget the Pear of Anguish, which was usually stuck in a person’s mouth (or other opening in the body) and by the turn of a crank, the pear expands. When in the mouth, it resulted in busted teeth, a dislocated jaw, and other unpleasant injuries.
These are just a few of the most shocking torture methods. It forces us to wonder about the psychological state of those who invented these methods.
