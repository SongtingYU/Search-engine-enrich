Manifold Destiny: The One! The Only! Guide to Cooking on Your Car Engine!

Giving new meaning to the term &quot;fast food&quot; Rest-stop grade F meat patty? Nah
Nuggets of reconstituted poultry bits? Pass
Deep-fried fish discus? No, really, thanks all the same
It&#039;s time to bid farewell to the roadside meal as you know it
Nearly twenty years ago, Chris Maynard and Bill Scheller opened the world&#039;s eyes to the beautym of car-engine gastronomy in the original Manifold Destiny
And now that another generation of both drivers and eaters has emerged, the cult classic is due for an overhaul
In this shiny, spanking-new edition, learn how to make s&#039;mores in your Scion, poach fish in your Pontiac, even bust out a gourmet snack from under the hood of your Escalade
With step-by-step diagrams, crowd-pleasing recipes, and thorough instructions, now you can turn your car into a kitchen without ever crossing any golden arches
Hilarious, bizarre, and ultimately (seriously!) useful, Manifold Destiny is and always will be an unparalleled original
So, slap a ham steak under the hood of your car, hit the gas, and drive until you reach delicious -- which is in approximately fifty miles, depending on traffic.
