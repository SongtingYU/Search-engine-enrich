In this video I explain how to define and call a function in Python.

Check out my book called "Python Programming Fundamentals" on the website http://cs.luther.edu/~leekent/CS1. This book is used by colleges in an introductory Computer Science class, but it can also be used by you to learn computer programming. The book has lots of examples and the series of videos I have published on YouTube complement the material found in the text. In fact, I have been using these videos as my lectures for my class that I teach at Luther College. The website also has links to files that I have used in my examples.
