Part 3 of our 5 part series on Python covers the Python interpreter: what it does, how to launch it, and how to use it.  The interpreter is a very handy tool to get familiar with Python without going through the trouble of making whole programs.  It's also a great way to check out chunks of code before adding them to your software project.

Check out part 4 as we take you through making and running your first program.
