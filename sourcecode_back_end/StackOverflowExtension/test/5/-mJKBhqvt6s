Writing a function to iterate over a String in Java and build a new string where some replacements have been made.

1) What is the name of my function?

2) What is the return type of my function?

3) What is the parameter sent to the function?

4) What will this function replace with the number 3?

5) How many letters does substring access on each iteration of the loop?

6) Why did I save the result of the call to substring in the variable let?

7) Why do I check let using equalsIgnoreCase?

8) What gets concatenated onto s if the current letter is NOT the target letter?

9) Write a function called AtoAt that replaces any occurrence of the letter a with the @ symbol.
