This video will show you how to create different functions to handle specific tasks within your program. 

For example:
int function(int x, double y){
return (x * y);
 }

This function accepts 2 values; and integer x, and a double y. The return statement multiplies the x and y together, then returns it to where it was originally called from as an integer value.

We can call the function this way:
int main( ){
int x = 2;
double y = 2.5;
function(x,y);
return 0;
}

Also make sure to cast the function and it's parameters outside the main scope:
int function(int x, double y);
