Hello There, Welcome back to pythoholic once again, Your one stop solution to learning pyhthon.
Today, I have a lot of things lined up for you.First, We will download Eclipse Mars. Install it, Add the PyDev plugin or the (Python Development Plugin)  to eclipse.
Create our first project in Eclipse and run our first program.

Before this, please ensure you have installed the Java development kit. 
If not, Please install JDK and JRE in your PC. And add that to the Environment Variables under your JAVA_HOME path variable.
