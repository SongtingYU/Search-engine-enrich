How to API enable your CICS applications in 10 minutes

Abstract:
APIs have become the de facto standard for application integration. z/OS Connect is IBMâ€™s strategic solution for API enablement of z/OS based applications. In this short video we show you how to create a REST API from a CICS application, and discover and invoke the API.
The demo starts by looking at the CICS sample Catalog Manager application. Then we show a Bluemix application that enhances the user interface with images, email notifications and address validation. The Bluemix application uses a z/OS Connect API to access the CICS managed catalog.
We show how the API is created and deployed using the z/OS Connect Enterprise Edition API Editor. And we finish by discovering and invoking the API from a REST client.
More information on the scenario can be found in the z/OS Connect Enterprise Edition V2.0 Getting Started Guide
