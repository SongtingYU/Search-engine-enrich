Chuck Quinton teaches you what the release looks like in the golf swing of Tiger Woods and how the typical amateur releases the golf club.

Effortless power and maximum clubhead speed comes from a proper release of the golf club. Releasing the golf club is very simple but can very easily be overridden by overuse of the right side of the body as you'll see in this clip.
