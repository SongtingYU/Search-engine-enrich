Windows Movie Maker is not a very precise tool, but this is a good enough example. Hint: video sound is overridden by imported audio, which in this case is the looped "Rap Chop" audio file I made in a different program. It's possible to do things like this entirely working with video, but I find working with sound alone is more accurate. There's a tendency to look for obvious visual cues, like cutting to a black frame, which may not properly sync up with the audio as you intended.

Blah blah blah I just loop things, see original videos for rights and etc.
