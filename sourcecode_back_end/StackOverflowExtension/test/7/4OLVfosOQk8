Let me explain the CRT's. The vitamin CRT didn't work because the CRT was for $2 off $10...The vitamins were $9.29 so that's why it didn't go through. My CRT's for the bodywash worked with no problem. I had $3 off $10 for Caress and I bought 4 of them the 2 regular price equaled over $10 so it applied. The only reason the vitamin CRT didn't work was because the amount wasn't close enough to $10. It wasn't because they were on sale. Michael thought that was why but I figured out why it wasn't because all of my other CRT's did....The instant coupons a lot of times have to be overridden that was even before the POLICY change. Just like with the 2-Liter instant coupons a lot of times those don't scan properly and the cashiers have to override and the same thing happened with these softsoap coupons. I hope this explains everything a little better. Hi Friends, I am so sorry this video was up so late but I had no energy after filming and then spent today (Sunday) couponing. But I hope you all were able to get some great deals. Have a great week.
