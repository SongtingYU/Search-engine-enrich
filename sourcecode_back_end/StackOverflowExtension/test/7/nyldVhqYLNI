I am growing more and more concerned for woman's reproductive rights . They are increasingly being under attack from the far right Christan fundamentalist . We have abortion doctors not being protected properly from domestic terrorist .  In some states, parental permission is required before a girl under age 18 can have an abortion . In some states there may be a 24 hour waiting period from the time you can speak to a counselor in a clinic or doctors office, until the time of the procedure.  In Oklahoma, a new law requires any woman seeking an abortion to first answer dozens of personal questions, including why she wants the procedure. That information, names omitted, would eventually be posted on a state Web site . And now Republicans have overridden a veto that now forces women and her doctor to undergo an ultrasound and listen to a detailed description of the fetus before getting an abortion. I'm telling you these Republicans and their right wing fundamentalist base are a bunch of sadomasochistic son of a bitches . As if a women doesn't have to go through enough pain in this hard, personal and private decision !? All because the Republicans want to win votes and all because far right Christians want to impose their faith on everyone . It fucken pisses me off ! If women don't want their reproductive rights taken away, they better start speaking up and loud . You better demand that you have a right to makes decisions about your own body . Let the politicians know they will not receive your votes if this continues . Even for people that don't have a direct vested interest in this should speak up . If you don't it just brings this country one step closer to becoming a theocracy . Anita Fream, CEO of Planned Parenthood speaks with Rachel Maddow about these disturbing developments in Oklahoma .
