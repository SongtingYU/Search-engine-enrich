It's craft ­beer, remixed, when world­-class DJ and producer Z­Trip heads to Dogfish Head headquarters in Milton, Delaware to make a crazy wheat beer cranked to 11 with some of his favorite culinary ingredients. After brewing mastermind Sam Calagione shows off his freestyle beer­-making skills, Z returns the favor by debuting a brand­-new track for a very special—and very odd—audience at the brewery.

Brought to you by First We Feast, "That's Odd, Let's Drink It" is a six-part series that explores that outer boundaries of experimental brewing. In each episode, Sam Calagione will create a never-before-seen beer inspired by an icon in another field—from culinary giant Mario Batali, to NBA superstar Chris Bosh.
