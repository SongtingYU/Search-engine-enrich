Pelvis positioning can be one of the hardest things to achieve when learning social dance. This actually gets back to how your core works. Plus some psychology, but that can be overridden with physical control.

This video goes over a basic exercise you can do daily to help you improve your ability to position you pelvis properly when dancing.

Note - this is not a professionally made video; it was just me filming myself at a local basketball court. The exercises are still good, but consider doctor advice before trying them.
