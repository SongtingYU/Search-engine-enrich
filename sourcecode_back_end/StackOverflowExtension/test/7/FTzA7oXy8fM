0:40 NO POWER
-First check the breaker switch
-If that is good you may have a burned out power circuit board

1:20 REMOTE WORKS BUT WON'T OPEN DOOR
-Check to see if the 'Lock' mode is engaged

2:19 LIGHTBULB FLASHES WHEN BUTTON IS PUSHED - CHECK THE SENSORS [most common failure]
-Verify that nothing is in between the two sensors
-Make sure the sensors are aligned
-Verify that both sensors have lit LEDs
-Verify no dirt or spiderwebs are blocking the sensors
-Check the wires for breaks and follow them back to the opener unit. Make sure they are completely inserted.
-Sometimes snow can cause the sensor to trip. Even morning/afternoon sunlight shining into the sensor lens can cause it to trip. 
-Override the sensor by holding down the button. If the door closes properly, you know you have a sensor issue.  Sensors can fail but it is not common.

5:18 REMOTE NOT WORKING
-If you need to push the remote several times to get it to work, that is a sign the battery is going bad.
-Most opener remotes use a CR2032 battery.
-Here is a video on how to test a GENIE remote battery http://youtu.be/N4qSkBzBTW4

6:13 HOW TO PROGRAM THE REMOTE
-Push the 'Learn' button and then the remote button to link the remote to the opener. The lights will flash.

6:40 KEYPAD OPENER NOT WORKING WELL

7:30 SOMETIMES THE REMOTE OPENS THE DOOR AND SOMETIMES NOT
-If your remote only works when it is super close, the battery in the remote is bad or the antenna wire is broken or needs to be soldered.
Here is a video on repairing the solder joints: http://youtu.be/I_yzesvN8AI
-The main circuit-board may need to be replaced. Here is a video on how to do that: http://youtu.be/1svaanF5Ka0
-You may also be having LED interference. LED lightbulbs can emit a RF [radio frequency] that is in conflict with the RF that the remotes use.

9:54 Motor making weird noise or weird noise coming from unit and the door won't open or close
-Check the capacitor.  If leaking it definitely needs to be replaced.

11:06 CHAIN IS HANGING OR DROOPING
-Check to see if the gear at the top broke.  You cant reattach it, you will need to buy a new gear set.  This is usually caused by a chain that is too tight but it could also be a result of a door that is not balanced.  An unbalanced door is a result of a torsion spring failure.
-If the gear did not snap off you may have just a loose chain that needs to be put back on and tightened.

13:19 DOOR BALANCING TEST
-Close the door and pull the safety cord. You should be able to open and close the door with not much effort.  The door should also be able to stay half open by itself.

15:12 DOOR NOT OPENING OR CLOSING WELL - TORSION SPRING
-Check to see if the spring has slipped off one end or broke in half
-You may need to adjust the spring. [not an easy job]

16:20 DOOR STARTS TO CLOSE BUT THEN REOPENS - TRACK ALIGNMENT
-Assuming the sensors have been checked, look to see if your tracks are out of alignment. I have a video on how to do that here: http://youtu.be/CewKaLlns0Q?t=1m38s

17:05 CHAIN IS MAKING NOISE - TOO LOOSE
-Loose chains can cause damage to other parts. Tighten it just to the point that it is not hitting anything. Don't try to eliminate all the sag.

18:37 NOTHING WORKED, MY DOOR STILL HAS PROBLEMS
-Check for loose nuts and bolts. Try to find something that does not look right. 
-Ask a question in the comment section about your specific problem and I will do my best to answer.

If your garage door is making a lot of noise you may just need to lubricate it or make some minor adjustments.  Here is a video that addresses that: http://youtu.be/csHpg2ZuWXI
