FAQ:

It isn't working?
You should try to use the file in the description as a reference to see if you got the equation correct. 

How come I cannot open the expression thing?
Press and hold ALT and then click the stopwatch. 

How do I Shorten the Length of The Composition from 20 seconds to 10 seconds?
Go to the effects panel and make the Slider control(SPEED) at 8.0, and the Slider Control(START AT) at 3.0. Then go to Composition, then Composition Settings, and make the length 00:00:10:00.

How do I Rename the Slider Control?
Go to the timeline, click the text layer, then Effect, then right click on Slider Control and click Rename.

I Get an Invalid Expression Error, or The Value doesn't Exist Error?
You need to Rename the Slider Controls to Speed and the Second one to Start At.

I get a "expected )" error or similar error?
It means you forgot a parentheses or a bracket or some small error, again check the file in the description as a reference equation to see where you messed up. 

The Text disappeared when i added the equation?
You forgot to change the Slider control(SPEED) from 0.00 to 5.00 or 8.00.
