http://ItsMyAcademy.com/Set-Theory/ For List of Set Theory Tutorial videos. Power set is set made with complete set of subsets. We can assume power set like the collection subsets. Empty set means set having no elements. We already know that every set has at least two subsets one set it self and another is empty set. But if we discuss about the empty set then empty set has only one subset which is itself. So, in power set of an empty set there is only one element that is empty set itself
