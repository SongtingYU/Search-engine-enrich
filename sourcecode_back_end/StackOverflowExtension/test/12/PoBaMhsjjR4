Giving this level a thumbs up would be appreciated!

If you join a server with me on it, don&#39;t ask for admin because I won&#39;t give it to you.

It is midnight in the Town of Robloxia when you notice your streets are empty. &quot;Hello!&quot;, you call out. Nobody answers so you keep looking around the town for any survivors. You quickly run to the Roblox-Mart where everyone shops. You find nobody inside. You find a ladder on the side of the store so you climb it. Then you see figures start coming towards the building. You find guns on the roof and take them. You then call your friends to come and help fight off the zombies.
