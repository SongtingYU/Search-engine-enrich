Just a quick fix WITH tutorial on how to resolve the recent empty server lists some of you are having, let me know if you have any additional questions or comments. 

I did not come up with this fix as stated in the video, any damage done to your system is on you, and I hold no responsibility. With that being said, here is the actual commands as stated in the video.

COMMAND Prompt as Admin:
ipconfig /flushdns press enter
ipconfig /registerdns press enter
ipconfig /release press enter
ipconfig /renew press enter
netsh winsock reset press enter
restart your computer

Thanks again for watching!!
