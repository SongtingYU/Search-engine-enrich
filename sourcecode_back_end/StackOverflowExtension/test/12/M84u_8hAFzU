We measured how much ink we throw away with each cartridge using an Epson 9900 series printer. We show you how to weigh your cartridge and calculate how much ink is still really inside. 

We waste hundreds of dollars in ink every month. We've had four Epson 9900 printers, and they're all like this.

Common questions in the threads: 

1) Does Epson put in extra ink to compensate?
Answer) No. We've checked. http://i.imgur.com/178jnYj.jpg

2) The audio is only in the left channel
Answer: I'm sorry. Well at least I used a good mic so it doesn't sound like I'm in a tin can. I should fix that and re-upload it. 

3) Your math formula is formatted incorrectly
Answer: Sorry about the incorrect semantics. You know what I mean. 

4) At 2:10 you show 350ml cartridge and 700ml cartridges as the same weight. 
Answer: Oops. Sorry. Yes, the empty 350ml cartridge weighs 196g. 

5) Why don't you put the cartridge back in and continue using it after cleaning?
Technically according to Epson you can do that, but the 9900 auto cleans itself many times a day, so you would have to switch out with a new cartridge every time. If you have several or many doing this at once, it quickly becomes impractical, if not impossible. 

6) How much $ do you throw away with each 700mL cartridge?
Answer: $40 to $50 with each cartridge. On average 120 mL per 700mL cartridge. Keep in mind their small cartridge is 150mL.
