From Tapes Punakaiki CD (forthcoming).
The album this song is from was meant to be released away back in 2006. The label that was to do it  finally declared itself defunct and I released this as a cassette/download on www.pseudoarcana.com.
I made the video for this in 2008 on a follow up visit to Punakaiki (New Zealand West Coast).
