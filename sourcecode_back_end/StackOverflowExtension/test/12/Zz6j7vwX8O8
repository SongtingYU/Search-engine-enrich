Schlomohttp://schlomo.tv Steve Garfield: So, it says &quot;camcorder empty&quot; and I&apos;m like, &quot;Oh, my God. The camcorder is empty!&quot; I&apos;m like, &quot;No, wait a minute. That&apos;s a good thing.&quot;  Schlomo Rabinowitz: Yeah. It&apos;s empty. I haven&apos;t used it today. I could actually put stuff on it. Is that what you mean that was a good thing?  Steve Garfield: They need a new wording for that.  Schlomo Rabinowitz: They do.  Steve Garfield: Camcorder is fabulous. Record.  Schlomo Rabinowitz: Yeah, camcorder is excited to be used. Camcorder excited.  Steve Garfield: Camcorder empty. Oh, my God. That&apos;s like a gas gauge.  Schlomo Rabinowitz: Exactly, seeing that&apos;s negative. Yeah, I agree.  Steve Garfield: I got to talk to user interface kind of. So, tell us who you are.  Schlomo Rabinowitz: I&apos;m Schlomo Rabinowitz.  Steve Garfield: And why don&apos;t you just tell us what the secret of online video is.  Schlomo Rabinowitz: To me, the secret of online video is really understanding how, you know, we all have these little toys, right? You understand that I could just run a gun and go &quot;Ba! Ba! Ba!&quot; but it&apos;s about now what do I do with that and how do I deal with my subject, how do I get what I need from them and make them feel comfortable, so in the end they look fun on camera and I&apos;m getting my information out and how do you do that. That&apos;s really the secret of online video because we&apos;re all talking about making concise things with crazy, click machines and now how do I make that happen like over here, they are doing an adoption service and I decided to do some on there and one of the people there is this little 10-year-old girl. So, I said, &quot;Hey, can we use her to represent the adoption service?&quot; Right? So, I got the little girl and we&apos;re talking. I said, &quot;Okay, so this is Little Missy, the dog,&quot; right? She&apos;s introducing the dog and I said, &quot;Since we&apos;re looking for an owner and we&apos;re at South by Southwest, what sort of music does the dog like?&quot; and she goes, &quot;Uh, Miley Cyrus?&quot; I said, &quot;Perfect!&quot; So, hopefully people will see this then Miley Cyrus may come adopt Little Missy, you know? That sort of thing. So, you get something fun as opposed to just, &quot;Here&apos;s the dog adoption service. Here&apos;s the static wide shot. Now, let&apos;s go in.&quot; It&apos;s a little bit more than that. It&apos;s between that and bringing a camera from here into here. Get a close up then go back. That&apos;s actually engaging online.  Steve Garfield: Oh okay.  Schlomo Rabinowitz: See? See?  Steve Garfield: Oh, wait a minute. Let&apos;s go find that dog. Where is that?  Schlomo Rabinowitz: Over here.  Steve Garfield: Okay. See an excerpt of this interview and more in Get Seen.
