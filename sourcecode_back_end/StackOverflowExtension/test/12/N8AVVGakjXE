In order to combine two separate objects into a single object we will need to perform what is known as a Manual Boolean Operation. Essentially a Boolean Operation is the process of combining one object to another and this can be done using automated tools but it is always better to do it through a manual process. This is because the Automatic Boolean tools do not pay close enough attention to maintaining quad shaped faces. We will create a separate box, shape it like a ball and then perform a Manual Boolean Operation to combine the ball to the hilt of the sword. In order to do so effectively we will need to get the ball into position first.

Once the ball is in position we will be removing a face so that there is an empty section on the ball which we can attach to an empty section on the hilt. In order to attach the vertices on the ball to the vertices of the hilt we will have to use the Combine Tool. The Combine Tool will make the two objects into a single object. Once they are a single object we can use the Merge Vertex tool to make both the surfaces into a single fluid surface. The Merge Vertex tool will allow us to take one vertices and merge it to another vertices but with the tool it will also move a vertices to a target or a relative center point between the two vertices based on our settings. Once we have combined the two objects into one with a single fluid surface we have performed a Manual Boolean Operation.
