This song has been probably the most challenging song I've had to learn for Sentinel and it is still not perfect but I'm happy enough with it too post a video. I'm also in need of some new cymbals. 

If you liked this check out my band Sentinel! Would be much appreciated. This track is taken from out EP "The History Weave" to be released 14th of August.
