Step 1: Start with the Brow Wiz pencil at the end of the brows. You can go thicker here if you want the brows to be a little bit longer. Stroke the pencil over the hairs and brush and blend to give a natural looking brow. It is better to go back over the same area a few times to build up the look that you want. 
Step 2: Swipe a little bit of Brow Fix onto a brow brush, this will help the powder to adhere to the skin. Dab the same brush into the darker powder from the Brow Powder Duo and go over the brow again to fill the color in. This will give the brow a thicker and bolder look. 
Step 3: For a little more drama, finish the look with Brow Duality. Using the Sand end of the pencil for a shimmer effect, swipe the highlight on the brow bone. Blend the color and and go over the highlight with Camille, which is the matte side of the pencil. This will give an instant brow lift!
