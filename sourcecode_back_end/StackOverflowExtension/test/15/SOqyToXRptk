Meet Kareltje (his name is extremely Dutch). He's new to my house, but he already discovered he has to share it with this evil piece of string that randomly appears from my kitchen drawer and attacks him. Thankfully, Kareltje knows how to defend himself. 

120fps 4x slow motion footage from my Oneplus Two. No cats were harmed during the making of this footage. Some string was harmed during the making of this footage.
