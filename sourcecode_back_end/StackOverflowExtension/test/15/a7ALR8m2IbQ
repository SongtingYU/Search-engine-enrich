Lyrics: Look like a girl but I think like a guy
Not ladylike to behave like a slime
Easy to be sleazy when you've got a filthy mind
You stick to your yogurts
I'll stick to my apple pie

Girls are not meant to fight dirty
Never look a day past thirty
Not gonna bend over and curtsy for you

Is there any possibility
You'll quit gossiping about me
To hide your insecurities
All you say is "blah, blah"

Girls they never befriend me
Because I fall asleep when they speak
Of all the calories they eat
All they say is "na na na na na" (na na na na na)
All they say is "na na na" (na na na na na)

Girls, oh girls, wag your tails to the beat
Of Girls Aloud, oh the journos in heat
Write such good stories
Oh their mothers must be proud
Making money of your insecurity and doubt

Girls are not meant to fight dirty
Never look a day past thirty
Not gonna bend over and curtsey for you

Is there any possibility
You'll quit gossiping about me
To hide your insecurities
All you say is "blah, blah"

Girls they never hear from me
Because I fall asleep when they speak
Of all the calories they eat
All they say is "na na na na na" (na na na na na)
All they say is "na na na na na" (na na na na na)

I feel I've been riding in a fast car
Burning dirty gas won't get you that far
I feel I've been riding up the wrong path
But I'm gonna make sure I get the last laugh

Is there any possibility
You'll quit gossiping about me
To hide your insecurities
All you say is "blah, blah"

Girls they never befriend me
Because I fall asleep when they speak
Of all the calories they eat
All they say is "na na na na na" (na na na na na)
All they say is "na na na" (na na na na na)

Girls, wag your tails to the beat (na na na na na)
