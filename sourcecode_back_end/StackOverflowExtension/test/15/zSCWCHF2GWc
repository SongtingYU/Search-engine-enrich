I am going back to school so I can have my degree once and for all. I work about 50-60 hours a week while going to school, so I have found an awesome way to finish my homework quickly, and get 100% on it every time!

Introducing studyblue.com - I am in no way affiliated with them. I don't care if you use them or not, just wanting to share my tips.

I know a lot of people on YouTube just troll around looking for something to complain about. Some of you will call it cheating. If you think this is cheating, then please don't do it. My rant at the end goes into more details.

Also, based on the feedback I should explain that this will probably only work on University level courses. In order or this to work you need to have lots of people who use study blue and have already taken the class before you. I don't think high school or elementary students are using study blue a lot, but its very popular in college.
In college, most teachers use questions from the teacher's guides of most popular textbooks. So if you use a main textbook for a class like Biology that lots of people also use, then there is a good chance that your questions will be in there. Most questions for general education classes will be in here. As you get into more specialized classes your junior and senior year, the teachers usually develop their own books and questions and this technique is usually not as successful.
