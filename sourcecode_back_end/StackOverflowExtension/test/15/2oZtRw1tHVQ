Glitchtale Season 1 Finale!

Oh boi, this was quite a ride. After almost 2 months of work I finally finished!. Nyx The Shield made the soundtrack and Strelok added the sound effects, I'm lucky to have them as my friends honestly. I hope you all enjoy this season finale, get hyped for season 2!. Well not too hype, I will take a small break after all. However I will be streaming some gaming in the meantime, see ya on my twitch!.

Chara and Asriel face eachother in a last epic battle, Asriel will attempt to save the world but the timeline itself is too usntable to take yet another reset. Will everything end well by the end of this battle?.
