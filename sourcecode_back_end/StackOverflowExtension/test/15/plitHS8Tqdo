In this tutorial, I am going to teach you how to crack a password-protected website. To perform the attack, we are going to use the Hydra password cracking utility, which will allow us to brute force both the username and the password. 

This tutorial is for BackTrack 5 and Kali Linux users.

Note: It is illegal to perform this attack on any website that you do not own. The information presented in this tutorial is for educational purposes only.

If Hydra is showing the wrong password, try updating Hydra using the following instructions.

HOW TO UPDATE HYDRA

The instructions below will guide you through the steps necessary to update Hydra from it's current version to version 7.5 (or whatever the latest version is). 

Step 1: Open a web browser

Step 2: Navigate to "http://www.thc.org/thc-hydra"

Step 3: Click the "hydra-7.5.tar.gz" download link

Note: The download link is at the bottom of the page. There may be a newer version available. If so, use the newest version instead of Hydra 7.5.

Step 4: Save the hydra-7.5.tar.gz file in your Downloads folder

Step 5: Open a terminal

Step 6: Type "cd Downloads"

Step 7: Type "tar zxvf /root/Downloads/hydra-7.5.tar.gz"

Step 8: Type "cd hydra-7.5"

Step 9: Type "./configure"

Step 10: Type "make"

Step 11: Type "make install"

That's it. The update should be finished. Now, start Hydra so you can confirm that the update was successful.
