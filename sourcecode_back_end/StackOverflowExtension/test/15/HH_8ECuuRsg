Will and Norm continue their build of the DeAgostini Millennium Falcon kit, a 1:1 replica of the studio model used for The Empire Strikes Back. At this stage, we're still building out the cockpit of the model, and examine some of the greeblies that will get attached to the exterior. Plus, LED lights!
