Directed by Kasia Koniar Music by Blah Blah Blah, one of the best Chicago bands: http://www.blahblahblahmusic.com  'Why Am I The Only One Laughing' is the first single from the album 'Thank You Thank You. Kudos to Kasia Koniar, Marcin Szalkowski, Solomon, Dario, Phill, Byron, Christina "Double Demos," Melissa Beyl, the WHOLE production crew. Flavia Lamoglia from the Blackstone Hotel, managers, prep & everyone from the Blackstone Renaissance Hotel. While comparisons to bands like The Smiths & The Cure are going to be inevitable -
much of which comes from singer Solomon David's bittersweet, prom-like vocal tone
& downtrodden-ly romantic songwriting -
Blah Blah Blah have definitely niched out a unique sound for themselves,
that should fit them among their contemporaries somewhere in between
the pop-nostalgia of Kenna
& the whispery sensibilities of The xx.

They released their debut EP, Charm, in the spring of 2010
& gathered a strong local Chicago following from both critics & fans alike.
And with this summer's follow up EP, Thank You, Thank You,
that fanfare should hopefully be spreading internationally as well.
