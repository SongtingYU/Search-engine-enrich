We really did try hard to catch him other ways but he was always just out of reach. Plus, he slept outside at night so we couldn’t even corner him inside the hen house. And, in case  you were wondering, he chased all the poultry – it was just that he was picking on the cockerel on the day we were filming. (We suspect he killed a younger cockerel too – though we couldn’t convict without better evidence.)

We’re looking for a new home for him – but I can’t see why anyone would want him. He may well go in the pot – not something we like to do but a necessary part of keeping animals of all sorts..
