[ Back in 2001, this game was a launch title. Ghosts&#39; colors were alternated, there were more furniture added in the Master Bedroom, no tombstones were in the front yard, Spooky&#39;s house had spikes on it, there was a strange purple ghost that would appear as a puff of smoke and pop up saying &quot;BLAH!&quot;, there were two couches in the Parlor,  Chauncey was gone and there were pink objects next to the teddy bears, there was a red apple-like object on the stove in the Kitchen, the spinning wheel moved back behind the door with the knitted ball being pink, King Boo didn&#39;t have a crown, there were differences in the Safari Room that you&#39;ll see on your own btw, only the shadow of the girl taking a shower in Ms. Petunia&#39;s room is seen; as Ms. Petunia herself wasn&#39;t there, there was a door in the Kitchen and the Dining Room that was boarded up, the entrance to the Ballroom was boarded up, and the number of boos doubled a bit.
