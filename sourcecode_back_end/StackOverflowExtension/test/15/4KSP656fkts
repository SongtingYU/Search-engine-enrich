Lyrics:

I've written you a song
A beautiful routine.
I hope you like it.
 
My technique can't be wrong;
I learned it from the screen.
I hope you like it.
 
I studied all the rhymes that all the lovers sing.
Then just for you I wrote this little thing:
 
Blah, blah, blah, blah, moon,
Blah, blah, blah, above
Blah, blah, blah, blah, croon
Blah, blah, blah, blah, love.
 
Tra la la la, tra la la la la, 
merry month of may;
Tra la la la, tra la la la la,
'neath the clouds of gray.

Blah, blah, blah, your hair,
Blah, blah, blah, your eyes;
Blah, blah, blah, blah, care,
Blah, blah, blah, blah, skies.
 
Tra la la la, tra la la la la, 
cottage for two—
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, 
darling with you.

Blah, blah, blah, your hair,
Blah, blah, blah, your eyes;
Blah, blah, blah, blah, care,
Blah, blah, blah, blah, skies.
 
Tra la la la, tra la la la la, 
cottage for two—
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, 
darling with you.
