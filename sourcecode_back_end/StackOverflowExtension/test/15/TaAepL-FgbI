This week, we're starting a new long-term build series, and it's a replica prop from Star Wars! We've ordered the DeAgostini Millennium Falcon kit, a 1:1 replica of the shooting model used for The Empire Strikes Back. The kit is being released a piece at a time every month, and it'll take about two years for it to be completed. It's a true endurance build, and we'll have friends join us throughout the series to help out!
