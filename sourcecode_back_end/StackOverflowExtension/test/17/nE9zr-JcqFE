This is a video on how to tell if your Skydrive Onedrive uses a lot of bandwidth and how to fix it.  If you have an ISP that has hard data caps and you are going over your data constantly then Skydrive or OneDrive might be the reason.  I found after blowing through our 300gig cap for the month in 7 days that it was the Skydrive which was trying to sync at all times even though it was up to date and no files needed synced.  I went into my Task Manager and looked under which programs were using the most Network and was able to find it.  I fixed this issue my moving all my files out of Skydrive.  I am now using Dropbox with no problems and under my data cap easily each month.
