I have tried to explain the steps to upload a image/file using servlet. For this purpose, i have made one home page (index.jsp), one servlet as controller and one class (FileUpload.java) as model to upload a file to images folder if the content is file type, and in same time it also explains how other form field can be extracted including file content.
It uses org.apache.commons.fileupload package.
