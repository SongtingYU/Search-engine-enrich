A simple walk-through of the process to add contacts into the Apple Address Book program. This is also how you add contacts to the FaceTime for Mac application in order to videochat with friends.

Remember, if you want to add contacts in order to use FaceTime, you'll need either their iPhone phone number or their Apple ID. An Apple ID is an email address that is registered with Apple.
