The os module in python offers many functions.
the os.path.getatime() function gives the last accessed time of given file.we need to pass the return value of os.path.getatime() function to convert the return value into our local time format
similarly os.path.getctime(),os.path.getmtime()
gives the creation time,modified time of files respectively.
NOTE : if the file is in current directory we can give only filename, other wise we need to pass complete path name of the file.
