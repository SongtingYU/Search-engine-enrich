Update #1: Since this video, someone has made a Script Generator which, using the same kind of system, makes this much easier and more flexible: http://forum.nolimits-exchange.com/comments.php?DiscussionID=3345

Update #2: If you only own the Steam version of NoLimits 2, the directory for the files that you need is C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/Common/NoLimits2.

This was a highly requested tutorial, and should help quite a few people. I made it simply to give everyone who cannot script (like me) the opportunity to create rides like Expedition Everest without too much effort.

The essential idea is that you take BlockScript from Script Park and implement it into your ride. Although partially limited (e.g. you need to use a set number of blocks), it should suit most people's needs.

A list of the block and switch names can be found about halfway through the video (which you can pause on while creating your coaster), but I highly recommend you watch everything before and after that, as it includes important information.

Happy auto-switch coaster making!
