In this video we take a look at importing REX files into Spectrasonics Stylus RMX using the SAGE Converter application which is included in the Stylus RMX package.

Importing REX files into RMX allows the core library to be expanded in any direction you wish. There are infinite possibilities, just add any of the thousands of REX libraries available or create and add your own files.
