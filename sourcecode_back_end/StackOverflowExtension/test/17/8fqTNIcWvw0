In this video I walk you through the steps of importing the Native Instruments BATTERY 3 kits into BATTERY 4.

IMPORTANT! If you do this you will no longer be able to use the BATTERY 3 Kits in BATTERY 3! So if you want to continue using BATTERY 3, make a copy of the BATTERY 3 Library first! This process will convert the BATTERY 3 Kits into BATTERY 4 Kits.

After going through the Batch Resave and Import process you can access your BATTERY 3 Kits in the LIBRARY Tab/USER bank.

You will need BATTERY 4.2.1 or higher.
