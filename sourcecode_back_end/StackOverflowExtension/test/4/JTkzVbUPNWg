Mission N. 32 - Last Chopper Outta LS

I just eavesdropped on a very interesting conversation. That diamond store that got hit last week? The ice is in a helicopter in a rooftop in Del Pierro ready to be moved out to the East Coast. They'll have muscle so you'd better tag-team this - put someone on a nearby roof with firepower while the other moves in for the cargo. I wouldn't normally poach, but this crew are idiots ;) Meet me back at the warehouse.
