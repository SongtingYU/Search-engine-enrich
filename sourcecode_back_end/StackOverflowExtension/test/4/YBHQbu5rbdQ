Give it to me I’m worth it
Baby, I’m worth it
Uh huh I’m worth it
Gimme gimme I’m worth it
Give it to me I’m worth it
Baby, I’m worth it
Uh huh I’m worth it
Gimme gimme I’m worth it

OK I tell her bring it back like she left something
Bring it bring it back like she left something
In the club with the lights off
Whatchu acting shy for
Come and show me that you’re wit it wit it wit it wit it wit it
Stop playing you know that I’m wit it wit it wit it wit it wit it wit it
Whatchu actin shy for

Just gimme you
Just gimme you
Just gimme you
That’s all I wanna do
And if what they say is true
If it’s true, I might give me to you

I may talk a lot of stuff
Guaranteed I can back it up
I think I’ma call you bluff
Hurry up, I’m waitin out front

Uh huh you see me in the spotlight   
Ooh I love your style
Uh huh show me what you got
Cuz I don’t wanna waste my time
Uh huh you see me in the spotlight  
Ooh I love your style
Show me what you got
Come and make it worth my while

Chorus

It’s all on you. It’s all on you. It’s all on you.
So what you wanna do
And if you don’t have a clue
Not a clue
I’ll tell you what to do
Come harder just because
I don’t like it, like it too soft
I like it a little rough
Not too much, but maybe just enough

Uh huh you see me in the spotlight  
Ooh I love your style
Uh huh show me what you got
Cuz I don’t wanna waste my time
Uh huh you see me in the spotlight  
Ooh I love your style
Show me what you got now
Come and make it worth my while

Chorus

OK I tell her bring it back like she left something
Bring it bring it back like she left something
In the club with the lights off
Whatchu acting shy for
Come and show me that you’re wit it wit it wit it wit it wit it
Stop playing you know that I’m wit it wit it wit it wit it wit it wit it
Whatchu actin shy for

Uh huh you see me in the spotlight  
Ooh I love your style
Uh huh show me what you got
Cuz I don’t wanna waste my time
Uh huh you see me in the spotlight  
Ooh I love your style
Show me what you got now
Come and make it worth my while
