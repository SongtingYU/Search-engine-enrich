33 year old, Real Chance of Love star, Ahmad "Real" Givens is taking the first steps toward fighting his stage-four colon cancer. A week after his diagnosis, the VH1 reality contestant has a treatment plan from his doctors at Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles.

You remember REAL and his hilarious brother Chance! They originally appeared on the "I Love New York" reality show with Tiffany "New York" Pollard, then got their own show...

Givens first got sick in January with what he thought was the flu. After multiple hospital visits, he was diagnosed last week with stage-four colon cancer. According to his rep, the disease has metastasized, or spread, into his liver and lungs. 

"Real is in good spirits but a lot of pain," the rep told Us of the Stallionaires rapper, who competed on I Love New York before he and his brother Kamal "Chance" Givens were offered their own dating game show.


Because insurance only covers "about 40 percent" of the expected costs for Givens' treatment, his family has set up a website to raise money. Donations will go toward paying the star's hospital bills.

"Anybody that knows Real knows that he is a tough, strong, spiritual individual, and will fight this off," a message on the site says. "Real is trying to stay positive and make a full recovery. He appreciates all his friends, family, and fans for helping him get through in this time of need."

Both Tiffany Pollard and Ray J tweeted, wishing REAL a "FULL" Recovery!!

Get Well, REAL!!!

Sincerely,
