Yesterday we had our Thanksgiving dinner. You see Marie has to have oral surgery the day before the &quot;real&quot; Thanksgiving, so.....we decided to have it yesterday. We invited some friends to come over as well, some could and some couldn&apos;t but we had a nice time regardless. Day 15 of NaVloPoMo 2009Listen to the music here
