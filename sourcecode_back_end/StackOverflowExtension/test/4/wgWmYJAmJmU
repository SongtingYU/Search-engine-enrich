HTTP status codes are an important way for a server to indicate the status of a request to a client. In this video we explore how we can utilise various status codes to indicate various errors to a client. For example when a client is requesting a resource that the server cannot find then the server should ideally return 404 status code. 

Next we look at HTTP methods. HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST and DELETE are common way for a client to indicate what it intends the server to do with the request.

Express provides an easy API to provide an implementation for handling HTTP methods and responding with a specific HTTP status code to a request.
