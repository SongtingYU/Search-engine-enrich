This script automatically steals enemy ultimates. It selects enemy just for a moment to do its dirty deeds. Mouse position in replay is updated 15 times per second. That’s why we see delay on selecting enemy hero when script runs during 8x slowmo.

Not enough proofs? 
Rubick didn’t steal anything except of ultimates for the whole game.
