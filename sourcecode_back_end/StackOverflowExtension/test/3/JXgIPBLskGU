APM Knowledge SIG Courageous Conversation: We really need to talk about the unfamiliar 2016

What do you do when you find yourself in unfamiliar territory? How do you improve your understanding? Do you work with other people to make sense of what’s going on, or do you draw your own conclusions? Why do some people seem to ignore the facts? What is a fact, anyway? 

These are just a few of the questions discussed at a Knowledge SIG Courageous Conversation with Neill Allan in April 2016. Sensemaking is the process by which people give meaning to experience and grasp at the unfamiliar. A Courageous Conversation is a small meeting to discuss a topic that is misunderstood, controversial, or doesn’t usually get aired. This video is a 10 minute whiteboard animation that encapsulates the views expressed at the meeting using words, metaphor and pictures.
