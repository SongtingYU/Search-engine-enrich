Any comments asking about the song name, artist, editing program or clips used will be completely ignored and deleted from now on. If you would like to know what they are, then use your apparantly non-existent common sense and read the video description. All the information you need is in here. So read it. Ok? Good.

Another video? HOLY SHIZ. xD

To be honest, I really don't like this video. The start is really... bleh and the rest is just boring. xD But I felt like remaking my old one, which was just with The Lion King and completely sucked. So here we go, a not much better version. Lawl. :3

I don't have much to say, apart from I hope you all like it more than I do. :s

Song: Mad World
Artist: Gary Jules
Program: Sony Vegas 7.0
