While a great supervisor for neighborhood lemonade stands, Ice T, real name Tracy Marrow, is better known for his success in the music and television industry. He was born on February 16, 1958, in Newark, New Jersey but moved to South Los Angeles, CA when he was in sixth grade to live with his aunt. Following high school, Ice T spent 4 years in the army before dedicating his life to becoming a hip-hop artist. In 1983, Ice T recorded his first single and, after being signed by Sire Records, released his first album in 1987. The year following, he created his own record label, Rhyme $yndicate Records. Ice T introduced his heavy metal band, Body Count, in 1991 and launched their first album in 1992. Ice T went on to release a number of albums through the late 1990s before staring in the hit NBC TV series, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, as NYPD Detective Odafin Tutuola in 2000. He continues to star in the series today.
