Welcome back to Kerbal Space Program! In KSP, you're responsible for building, launching and flying rockets in your own fledgling space program on planet Kerbin.

Even though an entire daunting solar system of planets an moons await exploration, today we're still trying to check an old goal off the list: get a winged space-plane into orbit! As if it wasn't difficult enough, I attempt to pilot said plane via the in-cockpit first-person view!
