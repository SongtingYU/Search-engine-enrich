Today we take a look at new Smok Vape Pen 22 starter kit. This starter kit was fantastic... until I had to fill it up again. This starter kit does have fantastic flavor and vapor production, and it is extremely easy to use, but the one flaw outweighs the pros. I hope that Smok can fix the design flaw, because if they can, I would give this little starter kit two thumbs up without hesitation (though it still does have the lack of adjustable airflow). I will be sure to keep everyone updated if they do push out an updated version of this device that can get around the major flaw that I was able to find on the Smok Vape Pen 22 Starter Kit.
