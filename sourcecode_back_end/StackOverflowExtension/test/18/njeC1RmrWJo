The Citygroup Center in Manhattan, New York, formerly known as the Citycorp Center, had a fatal flaw which could have led to a major disaster, killing thousands of people.
In 1978, the skyscraper's chief structural engineer, William LeMessurier, discovered a potentially fatal flaw in the building's design: the skyscraper's bolted joints were too weak to withstand 70-mile-per-hour wind gusts.
