For our first animation we had to make a snowman, apply some materials, add in a couple of colored lights, then add an animated camera. This project helped me learn that the camera doesn't quite behave how I thought it would (but completely makes sense). This was for CAD238 (Computer Aided Modeling and Rendering I).
