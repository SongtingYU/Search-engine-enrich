Description A common known engine failure issue with 2003-2008 Chrysler 5.7L Hemi.3.7L and 4.7L Valve seat failure(dropping) causing catastrophic engine failure. Depending on the engine speed at failure , It is feasible that even a rod could be broken .Cost parts/machining $1051.21. Cost of new engine, with same flaw! $9,221.00  installed.Mine ate a valve seat. (On a warm restart after running normal.) Just out of warranty. It sounded like a diesel engine then died. I thought it was the timing chain, I pulled the valve covers to check for time/chain stretch and valve operation , Normal , the # 5 cylinder on top dead center valve was a bit tight (due to the possible missing seat), then I checked the cylinders with a bore scope which confirmed my suspicions.(dropped valve seat). This Vehicle has never been overheated. With the numerous amounts of incidents of this matter I am shocked there hasn't been a recall! I've always had Chrysler and Chevy, I learned to drive in a 66 Chrysler 300 and thought the 300c would measure up! Great performance but materials and commitment to customers ??????????
