Arnie Gundersen, chief nuclear engineer from Fairewinds and Associates explains the venting design flaw in Fukushima and other nuclear plants.
Arnie Gundersen explains how containment vents were added to the GE Mark 1 BWR as a "band aid" 20 years after the plants built in order to prevent an explosion of the notoriously weak Mark 1 containment system. Obviously the containment vent band aid fix did not work since all three units have lost containment integrity and are leaking radioactivity. Gundersen also discusses seismic design flaws, inadequate evacuation planning, and the taxpayer supported nuclear industry liability fund.

also, leakspinner has good conversational data about the japan fukushima situation here on youtube. just type leakspinner in the search box and you will find his channel.
also, TheFreedom2choose on youtube has a lot of good news stories on Fukushima.
