C++ Programming Challenge: Working with Text Files and Array Of Objects

First read in, from the attached file called Program.txt (attached), a series of
names and ages. You should not assume you know how many rows are in the file. 
You will save the file to the c:\temp location on your computer. 
In the program, write a function called GetData that reads in the data into an array of objects that contain firstname, lastname, and age.
Then, define a class called person. You will have person.h and person.cpp files that
will contain 3 private variables to hold the three values strFirstName, strLastName,
and intAge. It should have public accessor and set functions, getFirstName,
getLastName, getAge, setFirstName, setLastName, and setAge. (these two files
correctly named and coded 50 pts).
The main app should have a function called CalculateAvgAge that gets an array of
objects passed to it, and the number of objects in the array, and calculates the Avg
age and returns it as a double in main.cpp (this function works correctly 25 pts).
So main.app should contain at least two functions, CalculateAvgAge and GetData.
