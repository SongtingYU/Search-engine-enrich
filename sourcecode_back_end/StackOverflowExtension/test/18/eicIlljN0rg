Running! I keep running in my head
Asking! I'm asking where do I belong!
I'm wrecking my brains, who must i be? can I escape, is this even reality?

Who am I? Where am I?
Why am I? Have I lost my sense of humanity?

Searching! I'm searching for my mind that's lost.
Seeking! I'm seeking my long lost home.
I'm playing hide and seek with a friend im my mind. where are you buddy?

please leave a messege. a clue. a sign. lost track of the faded line. got flared by the darkness while groping for light. aware of the solitude my heart feels no fright
, I know you're hiding behind the one door I can't find!

Who am I? Where am I?
Why am I? Have I lost my sense of humanity?

Who am i?
what am i? 
why am i?

why?
