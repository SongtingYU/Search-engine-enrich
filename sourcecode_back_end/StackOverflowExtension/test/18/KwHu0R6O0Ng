The Pokémon anime, as fun as it sometimes is, can be pretty head scratching at times. And most of the head scratching would be caused by some of the silliest, most bizarre and a lot of times completely stupid moments and mistakes and anime tends to make. Some of these moments are just a onetime thing (so far). Some other moments happen quite often. So I’m going to share with you today 10 moments/mistakes from the anime that are probably the common, or they’re ridiculous they just had to be covered. Enjoy!
