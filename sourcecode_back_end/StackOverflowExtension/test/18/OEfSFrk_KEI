It can take a little while for the implications of object-oriented programming to really sink in, but we start discussing them here as we compare OOP with typical procedural code (or, the code we tend to use when we just want to get something done).

Here are a few nice things that viewers have had to say about http://BuildAModule.com:

"Many thanks for the terrific video series on Drupal 7 - your excellent videos are simply the best source of training and information on Drupal in existence!"

"Chris has put together some of the best Drupal training material I've seen to date. I run a Drupal shop, and several of my developers have used Build a Module.com to get up to speed with working in Drupal 7. From what I've heard, they found the experience extremely valuable, and what's great for us as a team is that they can always go back and review material when they're tackling a particular problem."

"Firstly, let me say that I am finding your videos extremely helpful. It's always difficult at first to get into something new but your videos are really helping me find my way in."

"I recently bought the download of your twelve Drupal 7 Core Concepts videos. I am new to Drupal and they are excellent. In fact they are the best tutorial videos I have ever used in the past ten years of teaching myself HTML and PHP and then Joomla (I know, I was just experimenting.) and now Drupal."
