I've been selling online profitably since I was 14 years old.  Back then, I only bought on craigslist then sold on eBay and vice-versa.  Pretty soon, I discovered there was a way to sell more product without touching any of it.

This is called drop shipping.  Lots of people have asked me how to start a drop shipping business.  Well, there's really not much to it.  You just need an online store to sell on, a product to sell, and some marketing techniques.  Once everything is in place, it kind of runs itself.

In this video, I will show you exactly how to start a drop shipping business.  I will begin by explaining what drop shipping is and what you can expect, then I will walk through step-by-step, how to build an online store.

Building your store will take about an hour and $1/day for hosting.  Then, you will already be ready to start selling!

When you complete your store, you will need a product to sell and a way to market it.  E-mail your finished site URL and WPEngine receipt to me at zach@blogtojob.com, and I will send you my exclusive product sourcing and marketing guide!
