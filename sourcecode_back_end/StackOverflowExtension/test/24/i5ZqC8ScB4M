“If you want to start a business, what’s the first step you should take?” 

So this is a great question. The most important first step, bar none is an easy question. For those of you who are loyal subscribers of the channel, you already know what I’m going to say – you have to find your passion. You have to build a business around something that you are passionate about. 

You have to be a little bit crazy to be an entrepreneur because it’s going to be really, really, really hard and nobody really talks about how hard it is to be an entrepreneur. You just hear all the good things and the big wins and the huge successes but it’s really hard! It’s going to be the hardest thing you’ve ever done in your life – it’s starting a business and making it successful. It’s that hard. 

The same people, the logical people, the normal people, they’re going to quit because it gets too hard. So you have to have a little bit of crazy in you to be successful as an entrepreneur and it’s that deep love and passion for what you’re doing. The things that you would do even if you weren’t getting any money, even if you’re not getting paid, saying, “I need to keep doing this because this is important.” 

One of my favorite examples is George Lucas who started Star Wars and Lucas Films and Indiana Jones and his first six years in business were a failure, complete failure – six years! And his friends and his family said, “George, do the safe thing, get a job. What are you doing? This is not working. Okay, one year, two years… Six years?! It’s not working, man. Stop! You’re crazy.” 

And what kept him going, it wasn’t that he wanted to try to make a lot of money; it’s that he loved films. And he said, “You know what? I don’t care if I ever make money on this. I have to find a way to keep going because I love it so much.” That’s what kept him going. That’s what you need to find to keep you going. Lucas now is worth over 4 billion dollars. He’s a multibillionaire. But he only got there, it was never about the money for him, he got there because he loved what he was doing. 

So the number 1 most important rule, how do you get started – find you passion. Do something that you love and keep doing it every day. Find something that you can’t live without doing. You have to create this thing in the world because it’s a part of you and you have to share it and help other people achieve whatever their goals are. That’s your first rule. Believe.
