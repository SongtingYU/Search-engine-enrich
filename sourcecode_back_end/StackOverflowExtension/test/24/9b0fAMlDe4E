Kieron Woodhouse, Head of UX for Expert Market explains the differences between front end and back end web developers.

Front end and back end developers tend to have very different roles in terms of the web development process. 

Front end developers tend to focus on the visual elements and the architecture of the website, and they will tend to work very closely with UX and design to ensure that the site is usable and it's actually able to do what you want it do as easily as possible for the user. 

They tend to have a base knowledge in html, css and java script. 

Backend developers deal more with what powers the site and the core functionality. They'll deal more with databases, API's and application logic, just to name a few of the processes that they will be dealing with to make the site actually work.

They tend to have a background in C++, C Sharp or Java
