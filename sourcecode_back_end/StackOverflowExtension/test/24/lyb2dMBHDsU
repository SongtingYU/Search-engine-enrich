These are some of America's finest fighting warriors. Watch their training from the time they arrive at Coronado naval base, to when they qualify on the ranges, and fight through "Hell Week". This video gives you a good overview of the entire process of becoming a Navy SEAL. Do you have what it takes? ATTENTION!! We are moving!

Questions or comments email chris@usmilitaryvideos.net Want to win $5000 worth of ammo!?!?!? Thought that would get your attention!
Here at US Military Videos & Photos we have partnered with USCCA (United States Concealed Carry Association) to bring you this great chance at some great benefits! Our founder and owner, Chris Wagoner, is a life member of USCCA and believes in it completely! Why listen to him you say? Because he is a 33 year+ cop and police firearms instructor. He knows firearms!

USCCA is a great association that is designed to protect and educate the armed citizen! If you are thinking of carrying a firearm for self-protection, already carry one, have firearms in your home or know someone that does, this is for you!

USCCA provides education through its training courses, DVD’s and books. Online resources are first class and very well done. The USCCA magazine “Concealed Carry” is full of great tips, gear reviews, and legal information every responsible gun owner should know. If that was all they did that would be enough to check them out, but what is one of the best benefits is that they will provide legal protection for you if you are involved in that life and death incident where you use your firearm for self-defense! That’s right they have insurance for your firearms and also will provide legal counsel if you need them because of a shooting incident. That alone is worth the membership fees! The piece of mind of knowing you are protected by USCCA in that time of chaos and emotional turmoil is worth it.
So what do you have to do to get in on this $5000 ammo give away and check out the fantastic benefits of USCCA?
