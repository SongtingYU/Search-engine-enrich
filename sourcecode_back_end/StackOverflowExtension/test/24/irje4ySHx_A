FTC: I worked with audible to bring you this video! And audible has been saving my life since before I ever made a youtube video, so I felt like it would be nice to share with you guys my little secret to being able to get done summer reading books when you also have a million other summer homework items

I decided to do a, back to school, video, and just like i did, middle school vs high school relationships, i wanted to do, back to school middle school vs high school, last year i did a, back to school expectations vs reality, in this video i showed me buying school supplies, so its kinda low-key a, back to school supplies haul, haha, okay i hope you guys enjoy this, love, rachel, rclbeauty101
