My name is Alex Genadinik, I am a serial entrepreneur and creator of the http://www.problemio.com mobile apps which are some of the leading apps for planning, starting and growing a business on iOS, Android and Kindle with 300,000 downloads across all those platforms. Please subscribe to my channel, keep in touch, and of course, I am always happy when people download my apps and try them out.

When I created my original mobile app, the purpose of it was teach people how to start a business, and to guide them as they started their own businesses. I kept noticing that as people were working to start their businesses, they kept making the same mistakes over and over. Those mistakes centered around four core topics:
1) Business ideas
2) Writing a business plan and general business planning 
3) Marketing their business
4) Raising money to start their business

So I created more apps. In fact, I structured my mobile apps as a 4-app course which teaches people how to start a business. But the apps not only teach people how to start a business. The apps guide people as they start their business. On the paid apps, I personally provide help, and you can ask me any question about how to start and grow your business. The only topics I don't help with are legal or accounting issues.

Additionally, this channel has over 150 videos on various topics around how to start a business, and I add videos every day. So keep in touch by subscribing to this YouTube channel, and taking a look at my apps to see whether the channel and the apps can help you start and grow your business.
