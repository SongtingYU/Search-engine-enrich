http://budurl.com/HPLatex3000 | This is the new HP Latex 3000 Printer, the 3rd generation of HP Latex Printing Technologies. Offering outdoor durability and versatility with high quality, odorless prints*, low maintenance and the environmental advantages of water-based inks.**

The HP Latex 3000 is the latest addition to the industry-leading*** HP Latex Printer portfolio, helping industrial print service providers (PSPs) grow their businesses with a printing technology developed to address high-value applications. With the HP Latex 3000, customers can enjoy the proven benefits of water-based HP Latex Inks at a new level of industrial-scale speed and efficiency.

Since introducing HP Latex Printing Technologies at drupa 2008, more than 15,000 HP Latex printers have been shipped worldwide (as reported by HP in Q3 FY2013) producing greater than 100 million square meters of wide-format, grand-format and other print applications. HP expects these numbers to triple in just about three years, with the number of latex-printed pages rapidly growing as the number of solvent-printed pages falls by as much as 33% (based on HP internal data as of Q1 2013).

The HP Latex 3000 Printer will help drive this growth, allowing more sign and display customers to move pages from traditional solvent and UV-curable printers to HP Latex Printers.


* Some substrates may have inherent odor.
** Ideal for sensitive indoor environments, HP Latex Inks help create a safe and comfortable printing environment for print shop workers. HP Latex Inks are UL ECOLOGO and GREENGUARD Gold Certified(SM), while prints meet AgBB criteria and are A+ rated according to Émissions dans l'air intérieur. UL ECOLOGO Certification to UL 2801 demonstrates that an ink meets a range of stringent criteria related to human health and environmental considerations (see ul.com/EL). HP Latex Inks are GREENGUARD Gold Certified(SM) (www.greenguard.org). HP PVC-free Wall Paper printed with HP Latex Inks meets AgBB criteria for health-related evaluation of VOC emissions of indoor building products (www.umweltbundesamt.de/produkte-e/baupr­odukte/agbb.htm). Émissions dans l'air intérieur provides a statement on the level of emission of volatile substances in indoor air posing health risks if inhaled—on a scale from A+ (very low-emission) to C (high-emission).
