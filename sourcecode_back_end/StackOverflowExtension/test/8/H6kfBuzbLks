With Clean and Fresh™ mattress pads, pillows and pillow covers, your bedding does more than simply resist and repel spills and stains; it actually eliminates odors from the room, including those most common and offensive odors:  Smoke, pets, food and nighttime accidents.  And Clean and Fresh™ bedding doesn't simply mask the odors.  It eliminates them.  

How does it work?
Clean and Fresh™ provides total mattress and room protection, eliminating odors associated with pets, tobacco smoke, urine, moisture, body and food odors.  These products offer:
• Stain release and repel
• Antimicrobial protection
• Odor elimination

Our unique fabric treatment is applied to fibers and then subjected to extreme heat, activating Clean and Fresh™ for the life of the product. When odor molecules come in contact with Clean and Fresh™ odor-eliminating molecules, the odor molecules are safely neutralized and converted into harmless gases.  Scientifically speaking, if a particular odor is made of an 8-molecule chain, Clean and Fresh™ chemically breaks the 8-molecule chain down into (4) different 2-molecule chains.  The 2-molecule chain, a harmless, odorless gas, is not detectable by the human nose.
