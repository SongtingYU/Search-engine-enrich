The HP Latex 3000 Printer has been replaced by the HP Latex 3100 Printer. Learn more about the HP Latex 3100 Printer here: http://hp.tl/6002BaYJ6

HP has expanded its industry-leading portfolio* of HP Latex Printing Technologies with the introduction of the HP Latex 3000 Printer, helping industrial print service providers (PSPs) produce high-value applications with improved productivity, quality and versatility.

HP Latex Printing Technologies were introduced in 2008 as a water-based alternative to solvent ink technologies. Since then, more than 15,000 HP Latex printers have been shipped worldwide** and more than 100 million square meters have been printed with HP Latex Inks. HP expects these numbers to triple by 2016, with the number of latex-printed pages growing rapidly while the number of solvent-printed pages simultaneously declines by as much as 33 percent.*** Learn about the entire HP Latex Printing portfolio here: http://hp.tl/6005BQbjH

The HP Latex 3000 Printer will help drive this growth, allowing a broader range of sign and display customers to shift pages from traditional solvent and UV-curable technologies to HP Latex Printing Technologies.

Meet your industrial printing needs with the HP Latex 3000:
Creating a competitive advantage for high-volume PSPs, the HP Latex 3000 Printer offers broader media versatility, including heat-sensitive substrates, with the HP Latex Optimizer. This new ink solution ensures consistent image quality at high speeds as well as efficient curing at lower temperatures and with less energy than previous HP Latex solutions. Third-generation HP 881 Latex Inks also provide a scratch resistance comparable to hard-solvent inks on certain substrates,**** making them ideal for applications including retail displays, outdoor advertising, vehicle graphics and interior décor. 

The printer's increased production capacity lets high-volume customers meet tight deadlines, producing 830 ft2/hr (77 m2/hr) of indoor applications [printed in high-quality indoor 6-pass 6-color mode] and 1,290 ft2/hr (120 m2/hr) of outdoor applications [printed in outdoor 3-pass 6-color mode]. Standard carbon-fiber, dual-roll spindles also help reduce media loading times and the need for operator intervention.

Delivering odorless prints ideal for sensitive indoor display environments (note: some substrates may have inherent odor), HP Latex Inks help create a safe and comfortable printing environment for print shop staff. HP Latex Inks are UL ECOLOGO and GREENGUARD Gold Certified(SM), while prints meet AgBB criteria and are A+ rated according to Émissions dans l'air intérieur.

UL ECOLOGO Certification to UL 2801 demonstrates that an ink meets a range of stringent criteria related to human health and environmental considerations (see ul.com/EL). HP Latex Inks are GREENGUARD Gold Certified(SM) (www.greenguard.org).

HP PVC-free Wall Paper printed with HP Latex Inks meets AgBB criteria for health-related evaluation of VOC emissions of indoor building products (www.umweltbundesamt.de/produkte-e/bauprodukte/agbb.htm). Émissions dans l'air intérieur provides a statement on the  level of emission of volatile substances in indoor air posing health risks if inhaled—on a scale from A+ (very low-emission) to C (high-emission).
