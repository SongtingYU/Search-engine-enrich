http://www.SERoundtable.com/ - This special Thanksgiving edition of the Search recap has some interesting topics.  Google will be significantly changing the AdWords agency support model.  Google Instant Previews caused some big issues with Google Analytics.  Google's Site Operator seems to be less buggy, with a special comment from Matt Cutts.  Google has published an excellent set of documents on controlling crawling and indexing by Google.  Google may have updated the image search index.  Google has their second major AdWords Quality Score bug, this one has yet to be fixed.  Google Places has an issue with bulk uploading.  Google Social Search seems to be coming to Image Search.  Google had several logos, today there is one for Pippi Longstocking, and we had a few for Thanksgiving.  The Thanksgiving logos were interesting, leading to book sales - Yahoo, Bing and others all had logos as well.  That was this past week at the Search Engine Roundtable.
