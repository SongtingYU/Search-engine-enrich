A dear friend Tom De Lasaux  WA6SEK who I used to work with passed away a few years back. His son Corey took over as the WA6SEK repeater Admin and took his Father's ham radio callsign. The repeater identifies itself every 10 minutes using morse code, but every hour on the hour, it has a special ID. It's a recording of Tom using the callsign. This was a collaboration between Corey now WA6SEK, Myself .. Cliff Kibbe KF6EII . This is a memorial to a really good guy who I miss a lot. Tom & I had worked on an IT job, just two weeks before he passed away. This was recorded the very first time I had heard it, so I got a little emotional. It literally brought a tear to my eye.
