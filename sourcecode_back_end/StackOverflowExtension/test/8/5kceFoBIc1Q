Lyrics:
I could be your operator
I could bring you joy
Something like a freedom fighter
Guns ain't just for boys

I heard what you said 
You should say it again, cause its bold
Its getting late 
Darling get a move on it, we should go 

You should never tell your mother
You should give it time
Pour a drink, here, have another
Cause this is gonna blow your mind

Heard what you said 
And I say what i mean
We should go 
Pack up your things
I don't care what you bring
Leave your house for a home

You should call your little brother
Tell him to be good
Tell him that you really love him
You don't...but you should

Heard what you said, so don't say it again
Cause it's cold
It's getting late, we should get a move on it
We should go 
Go

I could be your moneymaker
You could be my song
Worry bout the others later
We should get a move on
We should go
Pack up your things I don't care what you bring
Leave your house for a home
