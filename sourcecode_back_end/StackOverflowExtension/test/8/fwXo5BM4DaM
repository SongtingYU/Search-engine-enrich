(11/16/2014 13:09 PST) While I was at work and away from my radio, I had my scanner audio recording on the Mike and Key Amateur Radio repeater at home and happened to hear multiple transmission of this dude without identifying his call sign (and I think it's obvious that he probably doesn't have one). Under Federal Communications Commission's rules & regulations, it is illegal for a person to transmit on a frequency without identifying their call sign first and it is ALSO illegal for licensed amateur radio operator to contact that person in question. - uploaded via http://www.mp32u.net/
