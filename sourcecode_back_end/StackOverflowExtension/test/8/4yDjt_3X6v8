HP WallArt* is design made easy
Let your customers take creative control. With a simple, easy-to-use design tool, customers can get the job started on their own using personal photos, your own image gallery, or by searching a vast library of high-quality images, designs and artwork from market-leading partner, Fotolia**.

Streamline production
Watch your production take off as manual steps are trimmed. Print-ready files are automatically generated in the cloud. Key partner solutions-Dropbox, RIPs, Fotoba cutters are integrated into the workflow. Even installation is streamlined with preconfigured panelization and installation instructions. Improve your workflow efficiency with less manual processing.

Make a bold move
Make this market your own. Connect with customers through your website, your brand. Set up your own content management, file projects in your own folders. Set your software developers loose with APIs that help you complete web-to-print integration. Offer the ultimate design experience -with the iPad app, design goes onsite, using actual wall images.

Helping you go green, go clean
Accept nothing less than high environmental standards. HP Latex Inks help improve the work environment. Prints are odorless***.
