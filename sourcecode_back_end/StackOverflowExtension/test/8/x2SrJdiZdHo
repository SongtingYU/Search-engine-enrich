Freedom is the BYOU operator for sliding gates up to 300 kg.
Simple and easy to install, it has numerous strong features. The
inclined position of the control unit inside the motor makes
programming operations simple and immediate, while the motor
wiring is simplified by the possibility of adjusting its height and
depth, by its compact dimensions and ergonomic lines.
Equipped with electromechanical limit switches that allow
stopping of the motor, FREEDOM is characterised by an anticrushing
system with amperometric detection and by the
possibility of system operation even in a power cut, thanks to
batteries that can be perfectly integrated in the motor.
Possibility of unlocking with a key.
