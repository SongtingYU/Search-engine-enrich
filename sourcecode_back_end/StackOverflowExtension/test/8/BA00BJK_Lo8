Hey guys, and welcome to the Black Ice DLC Operator guide series! For the first operator we will be looking at the Canadian Attacker Buck, and the tactics behind his Skeleton Key ability.

His Shotgun Attachment is useful for breaching through doors relatively quickly, It's faster than hitting a door down, however it's still slower than using Sledge.

Unfortunately even though it's called the Skeleton Key it isn't able to open up Castle Barricades, which is a bit of a shame but keeps the balance of abilities still fairly balanced. It can also be useful to counter defender shotguns in close-range, and give you some options should you use his marksman rifle, enabling you to safely enter close-range combat.

His marksman rifle is less powerful than Glaz's and cannot penetrate Castle barricades or bullet-proof windows, but it still deals a hefty amount of damage per shot, and adds a little more long-range combat into the game - always useful to get the drop on Pulse, or stay out of those Kapkan traps!

Hope you guys enjoy the quick breakdown and stay tuned for Frosts operator video coming soon.
