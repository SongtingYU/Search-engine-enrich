In this vintage United States Navy Department of Defense (DOD) film from 1944, the technique of using a straight, mechanical hand key to "send" "International Morse code" (as different from "American Morse code", used by railroad landline communications) by radio to ships, and other receiving stations is explained.  

The hand sending key is detailed. Then how to use the key to tap out Morse code, which keys a radio transmitter.

The film specifically trains the viewer on the important parts of the transmitter, tension spring, adjusting the hand key contacts, and adjusting the tension spring of the straight key. Then, the elements of Morse code, the timing, and the parts of the Morse code communications operator's body that function when transmitting the CW code are explored. The film focuses on the importance of correct body position and hand key operation.  A lot of these details are still important for the modern amateur radio operator interested in using Morse code on today's world-wide radio technology that still uses shortwave radio spectrum to send and receive these CW signals.
