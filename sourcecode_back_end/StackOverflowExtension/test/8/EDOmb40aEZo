This now holds the record for the longest time spent researching and writing any single piece on TIFO by a very good margin. 

It turns out there are an awful lot of Star Wars "facts" commonly repeated all over the place that aren't when you really dig deep. We also really wanted to come up with a bunch of Star Wars facts (and extra details in those facts) that even the biggest Star Wars aficionados would find interesting to read and would learn something new on a good percentage of them. Here's hoping it was all worth the effort. :-) 

And yes, we are aware it's "Expanded Universe" rather than "Extended" and there are a few little name mispronunciations in this one.  ;-)  Unfortunately due to the extreme time this one took over the last couple weeks, and insane amount of time to record and edit up once the script was done, we didn't have time to go back and fix these as we'd normally do.  Morituri te salutamus!
