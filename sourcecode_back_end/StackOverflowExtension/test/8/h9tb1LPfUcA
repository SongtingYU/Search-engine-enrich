In this video is a top 5 of cards that Konami should hit in my personal opinion, but probably won't. My ban list prediction is coming soon, probably uploaded on Thursday if the list is not already up, and with that none of the cards on this list will be on that list. Tell me if you guys agree with me or not and what cards you think Konami should hit. I hope that you guys enjoyed this video and look forward to my prediction, thanks for watching.
