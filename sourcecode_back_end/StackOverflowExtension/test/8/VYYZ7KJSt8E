Re-introducing the HP Latex Printers you know and use, now with new names: HP rebranded its industry-leading portfolio* of HP Designjet and Scitex latex printers and supplies. The new sub-brand for these offerings is HP Latex, demonstrating the strategic importance of latex to the HP Large Format Graphics portfolio.

HP also expanded its industry-leading portfolio* of HP Latex Printing Technologies with the introduction of the HP Latex 3000 Printer, helping industrial print service providers (PSPs) produce high-value applications with improved productivity, quality and versatility. 

"Industrial print service providers constantly battle increasing competition along with shrinking timelines and budgets for big projects in this buyers' market," said Xavier Garcia, vice president and general manager, Large Format Production and Industrial Division, HP. "As the leader in large-format printing, HP is offering latex solutions that give our customers a unique advantage to cost-effectively address these challenges with new levels of productivity, quality and application versatility."

HP Latex Printing Technologies were introduced in 2008 as a water-based alternative to solvent ink technologies. Since then, more than 15,000 HP Latex printers have been shipped worldwide** and more than 100 million square meters have been printed with HP Latex Inks. HP expects these numbers to triple by 2016, with the number of latex-printed pages growing rapidly while the number of solvent-printed pages simultaneously declines by as much as 33 percent.*** 

The HP Latex 3000 Printer will help drive this growth, allowing a broader range of sign and display customers to shift pages from traditional solvent and UV-curable technologies to HP Latex Printing Technologies.

Delivering odorless prints ideal for sensitive indoor display environments (note: some substrates may have inherent odor), HP Latex Inks help create a safe and comfortable printing environment for print shop staff. HP Latex Inks are UL ECOLOGO and GREENGUARD Gold Certified(SM), while prints meet AgBB criteria and are A+ rated according to Émissions dans l'air intérieur.

UL ECOLOGO Certification to UL 2801 demonstrates that an ink meets a range of stringent criteria related to human health and environmental considerations (see ul.com/EL). HP Latex Inks are GREENGUARD Gold Certified(SM) (www.greenguard.org).

HP PVC-free Wall Paper printed with HP Latex Inks meets AgBB criteria for health-related evaluation of VOC emissions of indoor building products (www.umweltbundesamt.de/produkte-e/bauprodukte/agbb.htm). Émissions dans l'air intérieur provides a statement on the  level of emission of volatile substances in indoor air posing health risks if inhaled—on a scale from A+ (very low-emission) to C (high-emission).
