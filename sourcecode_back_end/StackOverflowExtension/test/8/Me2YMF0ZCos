http://hp.tl/6005BQbjH |  Since introducing the industry's first latex inks for large-format printers at drupa 2008, HP has installed more than 11,000 latex printers worldwide and produced more than 54 million square meters of printed material (data as of drupa 2012). HP Latex Technologies also have helped PSPs enter new markets, such as wall coverings, textiles and traffic signage. At this year's drupa, HP added additional solutions to extend the possibilities of latex printing, including a platen cover for the newest HP latex printers -- HP Designjet L26500 and L28500 -- that improves loading of textile media for the production of high-value soft signage and temporary textiles. 

In this video, HP Designjet L26500 and Designjet L28500 product manager Jordi Casas walks you through HP Latex technology and the new solutions available for the latest generation of HP Designjet Latex Printers. From broad media versatility to outstanding image quality, prints that come out dry to odorless prints, find out how HP Latex printers can help you grow your business and enter new markets.

*Prints produced with HP Latex Inks are odorless even immediately after printing, making them ideal for residential, office, hospitality, healthcare, or other environments with similar needs (note: some substrates may have inherent odor).

**Special ventilation is not required to meet U.S. OSHA requirements on occupational exposure to VOCs from HP Latex Inks. Special ventilation equipment installation is at the discretion of the customer -- no speciÔ¨Åc HP recommendation is intended. Customers should consult state and local requirements and regulations.
