At speeds up to 978 sq. ft/hr (91 sq. m/hr), the new HP Latex 300 Printer series delivers durable, high-quality prints at top speeds enabled by the HP Latex Optimizer ink solution. Optimized for the HP Latex 310 and 330 Printers, the easy-to-use SAi FlexiPRINT HP Basic Edition Raster Image Processor (RIP) software is bundled with these printers for faster production.* Additionally, water-based HP Latex 831 Inks deliver odorless prints** - requiring no special ventilation or outgassing -- that come out completely dry, ready to finish and deliver. 

* SAi FlexiPRINT HP Basic Edition RIP software is bundled with each HP Latex 310 and HP Latex 330 Printer. FlexiPRINT HP Premium Edition and FlexiPRINT HP Pro Edition are available as an option for the HP Latex 360 Printer and as an upgrade path for the HP Latex 310 and HP Latex 330 Printer.
