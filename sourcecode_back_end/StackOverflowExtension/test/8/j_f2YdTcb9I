Hello everyone. I'm really bored right now so I decided to this list.
The WEEABOO levels yaaay =D. This list is going to include Weeaboo levels that related to Anime, Manga and Video Games. This list is going to include levels that have: Pixel arts, Line art and Artistic arts. Sorry but I didn't included the levels that don't relate and just uses the songs.
