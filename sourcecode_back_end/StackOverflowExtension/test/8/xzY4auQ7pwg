For Thursday December 10, TheStreet awaits quarterly results from Adobe Systems (ADBE) and DAVIDsTEA (DTEA), which will be reporting their latest financial results after the closing bell. Aside from earnings, a lot of investors will be paying close attention to Yum! Brands' (YUM) annual investor day in Dallas. The restaurant operator based in Louisville, KY at the end of October announced that it'll spin off its China division into a publicly-traded franchisee in Mainland China. The new entity will pay a portion of its sales to its parent company for exclusive rights to three brands, including KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, according to CNBC.com. We also have several economic reports on tap. The day begins with jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. Eastern. For the December 5 week, forecasters see initial claims holding steady, up 1,000 to a still very low 270,000. Along with this report, import and export prices will come out. Then in the afternoon, the treasury budget will be released. TheStreet's U-Jin Lee reports in New York.
