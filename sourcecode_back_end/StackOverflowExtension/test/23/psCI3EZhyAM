He broke her heart, but that hasn't stopped Megan McKenna from seemingly sharing a very friendly moment with her ex Pet Wicks.

The pair were snapped filming TOWIE scenes at Chloe Sim's Essex salon today when the pretty brunette was caugh flashing a huge pearly white grin his way.

The reality stars appeared to share a joke together, while Chloe stood close by.

The TOWIE beauty was left devastated after discovering he had been texting TEN other women, but has she already forgiven him?Whatever's going on, Megan - who recently admitted she still loves him despite what went on - seemed happy and relaxed in his company.

Meanwhile, Megan recently faced some serious flack from her former flame Scotty T , who branded her a "ratchet c**t".

The Geordie Shore hunk didn't mince his words in a foul mouthed rant about his ex Celebrity Big Brother housemate during a recent Facebook Live chat in which he played a game of Snog, Marry, Avoid.Referring to their split, Scotty condemned him for getting caught - but saved some criticism for his former love interest.

He told The Sun: "He shouldn't have been sending pictures of his chopper to his ex bird. No good that, if you're going to do that don't get caught.

"Saying that Megan is ruthless like. She's an absolute f***ing ratchet c**t, I wouldn't get on the wrong side of her man. Liberty."
