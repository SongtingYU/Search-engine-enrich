1. #KatiFAQ hey Kati they are referring me to psychoanalysis and im so nervous and no one answers my questions. What is it? would i just talk and the therapist would just sit and listen?  how is it different from talk therapy or cbt etc? and they told me I'll remember stuff from my childhood, how do they do that?
2. KatiFAQ: My psychiatrist says I have major control issues (I call myself a control freak) as my anxiety level raises up when I'm not in charge of an even or when people who I work with or friends seem not to take their tasks seriously. Since I was a child, I've always been a perfectionist and when situations seem to get out of my control, I get really upset at those people and I tend to cut them off of my life. It's either black or white. But lately it's been worse and my inner circle of friends tend to be even shorter I'm afraid I will end up alone. What can I do to ease my urges to control everything? 
Thank you so much for your hard work. 
3. Recently my friend has been telling me that I am too attached to her and this happened with an old friend. Im scared this friend is going to leave me like the other one. I always end up getting to close, is there ways to stop?


Journal Topic:

Is there something you are stuck on?? Something that you always find yourself struggling with or going back to?? Let's make a collage about it. It can tell us a lot more about a situation than you think!! Get out some old newspapers, magazines etc and get started!!!
