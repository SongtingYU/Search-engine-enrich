how to install Revit 2013 SDK Revitlookup Addin
the following commands exist
1.Hello World...
The classic bare-bones test.  Just brings up an Alert box to show that the connection to 
the external module is working.
2.Snoop DB...
This command allows you to browse all of the Elements within the current document and view their exposed properties.  There has to be code written to extract all the individual properties of an object.  As a result, when new classes or methods are added to the system, they will not be visible until code is explicitly written to display them.  Because, the properties of an object are obtained in a top-down manner, all object types will at least be able to display common base class properties, even when newly added.
3.Snoop Current Selection...
Same as the above command, except that it starts you off Snooping only the elements that were part of the current selection set.
4.Snoop Application...
Same as above, except that you start out at the Autodesk.Revit.Application object which is originally passed to the command.
5.Test Framework ...
This command packages a set of individual tests into a single location.  As new tests are written, they are plugged into this same Form without the need to define new external commands and hook them up to the system.  The black "CLS" nodes of the tree represent which Class the tests concern.  The grey check mark nodes represent an individual test.  To run a test, simply choose a check mark node and press OK.
