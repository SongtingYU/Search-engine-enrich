Creativerse is a F2P (freetoplay) game that I enjoy immensely. I've gone so far as to call it Minecraft 2.0. That's not to say it's a copy, but referring to the fact that feels like a significant upgrade. It isn't as polished as Minecraft in many ways, but is also much newer so I don't mind looking past that. More than any comparable game, Creativerse just FEELS like a good place to spend time. Its stunning graphics, beautiful lighting, and immersive sounds make for a pretty great experience.
