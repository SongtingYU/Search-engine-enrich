To view the texts clearly, play the video in HD.

I made this presentation cum video for the annual exhibition held at Montfort inter college (formerly known as Mahanagar Boys' Inter College) in the academic year 2013-2014.

In this video I have described the main advantages and disadvantages of using social media.

I used only two softwares for making this video :
1)  Microsoft Office 2013 {Powerpoint}.
2)  Nero 12.00 Platinum, full multimedia suite {Nero Video}.


Links for downloading the softwares : 
1)  Microsoft office   http://office.microsoft.com/en-IN
2)  Nero full multimedia suite  http://www.nero.com/eng/
NOTE- They are the trial versions, the links will take you to the website of the owner. Please don't ask me for any cracks. If you want cracked versions go and waste your time on GOOGLE searching the cracks.
