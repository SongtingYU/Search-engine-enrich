Diamond problem is the situation in multiple inheritance where we have a common method in the super classes. Rather than providing some complex way to solve this, java doesn't allow multiple inheritance since we can always solve it easily using Composition.
We can create the classes as instances and call method from any of them, whichever we want.
It's called diamond problem because of the class diagram shape of multiple inheritance looks like a diamond.
