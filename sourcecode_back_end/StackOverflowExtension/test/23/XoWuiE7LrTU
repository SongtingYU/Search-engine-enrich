Rick asks Maria Paolozoa, of http://www.mygolfinstructor.com, what it means to be laid off. Maria explains that the term "laid off" refers to being under the swing plane either at the top of the swing plane or on takeaway. The swing plane Maria is referring too is the shaft plane, which is a line drawn from the head of your club and up the shaft through the grip indefinitely up to the sky at address.

Most of the time, people are referring to being laid off at the top of the swing, which means, for a righty, the golf club will be pointed well left of their target line at the top.

When a player is laid off on the takeaway, they are rolling the club too far inside and under the shaft plane line.  The club head quickly gets behind their hands.
