This video looks at how you overcome the problem of needing to extend (inherit from) more than one abstract class.  The problem occurs when you want to create a GUI and inherit from one (or more) other abstract classes apart from JFrame.  This requires you to create a new class which extends the other abstract class and then creating an instance of that new class.  Complicated ... the idea is, but the coding is not that difficult.
