Are you avoiding something in your life?  Stop it!

In this video, I ask the question, what are you avoiding? 

I ask this question because I have been avoiding and I came to terms with that today.  I actually faced some things I've been avoiding. 

Ever heard the saying, what you resist persists? 

Yep....

I learned that the more I wa avoiding some things/people in my life, the more those things/people showed up. 

Really?!? 

Ever worked hard to avoid something and it keeps showing up? 

Frustrating and VERY revealing. 

I have NEVER been an avoider in most things in life.  I don't enjoy confrontation so I don't go looking for it, but when I have to face things I do. 

Even in death. (referring to the passing of my mother)

I am familiar with being uncomfortable with some things and having to DO them anyways. 

Today, I got uncomfortable, I humbled myself, and I was willing to see that the VERY things I avoid are in my life for a purpose. 

Today, I saw clearly in one particular situation, that my growth depended on facing this thing, and no longer avoiding it. 

What are you avoiding in your life? 
What would happen if you planted your feet, stood up straight and..

FACED IT....

No more avoiding! 

Leave me a comment on your experience with this.
