In C++ classes that have pointer as data members and deep copying and automatic deallocation of memory is required, the rule of three used to be enforced. Now with C++11 that has expanded to rule of five, with such classes requiring a move copy constructor and move assignment operator. Call to move members can be made explicitly using the function std::move. Use of move members allows faster code execution, when deep copy is needed, but object from which copy is done is not needed after the copy or assignment process.
