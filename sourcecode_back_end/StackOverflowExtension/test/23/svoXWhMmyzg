Read below for a text version of the birth plan! And by "present-day", I mean over a month ago... I suck at editing/uploading in a timely manner...

Birth Plan

Labor
- Documenting the labor/birth (ie. pictures/video) is VERY important to us. Please inform us if you are aware of any approaching pivotal moments so that we may capture them.
- Avoid referring to the baby as a girl or "she". (I am paranoid that it isn't!) 
- I would like the option to labor in the birthing tub, so having the tub filled as soon as possible would be nice.
- I would like to labor as uncoached as possible, but I've only done this once before, so position suggestions, reminders to breathe/relax or any other bits of knowledge you may impart are welcomed.
- Unless the lights become bothersome, I would prefer to keep lights on.
- I prefer to be checked for dilation the least amount possible.
- If possible, I would like to avoid using an IV/oxygen
- I would like to be informed of procedures/checks before they occur and know why they are occurring. 
- Remind me that this is natural and I am meant for this. "Let your body do what it needs to do" "You CAN do it! You've done it before!"
- Avoid "fluffy talk" (i.e. "you are a blossoming flower" and other cheesy metaphors). I prefer literal explanations of what's occurring. 
- Last time, I preferred to be in control of physical comforting (ie. don't spontaneously grab hand/rub back. Let me grab hand or ask for back rub)
- I would like to leave my bathing suit top on for the duration of the birth for picture purposes. It will not bother me if it is wet.

Birth
- I would like to refrain from pushing until my body begins to push on its own. 
- Remind D**** to inform T**** of when the pushing stage starts so that she may arrive as close to baby being born as possible.
- We would like to attempt a water birth. Remind us of this as the time nears so we may get into the tub, if that's what we still want at the time.
- Encourage me to push and hold so that I might stretch, rather than tear. I would like to minimize tearing, but may get impatient and attempt to push too quickly. 
- Refrain from mentioning whether or not the baby has hair (I am likely to over-push in attempt to see for myself)
- Do what you can to avoid tearing (i.e. perineum support, olive oil, etc)
- If possible, Derrick would like to catch the baby. Please let us know when time is near so he can get into position, if that is what we still want at the time.
- Please allow us to check the sex of the baby ourselves rather than announcing.
- If possible, we would like to delay cord-clamping until the cord has stopped pulsating.
- If possible, Derrick would like to cut the cord. 

Post-Birth
- I will be having my placenta encapsulated, so handle in food-safe ways.
- Please inform D**** of when you have finished inspecting the placenta as I would like to consume a smoothie containing a chunk of placenta as soon as possible post-partum. I know. YUCK! D**** will be preparing the smoothie.
- Getting cleaned up as quickly as is possible without interfering with bonding is preferable. We would like our son to visit his sibling as soon as possible, but would rather he not see the nitty-gritty.
- No restrictions as to who is allowed to visit. However, We WOULD like any visitors to wait until I am a "presentable" (ie. blood free, wearing a regular shirt, etc)
- We do not want eye ointment for the baby.
- We would like the Vitamin K injection and PKU test for the baby
- Hollie is rh-neg, so baby needs to be tested for rh-factor.
