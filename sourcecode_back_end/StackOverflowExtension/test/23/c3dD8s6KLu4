Obama Administration teaching how to avoid Iran sanctions

(TRUNEWS) President Obama’s administration is giving advice on how to get around Iran sanctions.

The State Department has reported officials are helping foreign banks give Tehran access to millions in frozen assets, according to the Washington Free Beacon.

Mark Toner, the State Department Deputy Spokesperson said the U.S. is committed to helping Iran access billions stored in banks across the world. He seemed to agree that Obama is helping foreign companies avoid sanctions when questioned by reporters.

“It is incumbent on us to live up to our end of this deal,” Toner said, referring to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.

But the Iranian government hasn’t lived up to its end of the deal. They have conducted several tests, including testing ballistic missiles, as reported by TRUNEWS.

When asked by reporters, the White House official would not comment on whether foreign banks could conduct transactions with U.S. dollars.

In an effort to thwart the plan, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) have drafted legislation to prevent the Treasury from allowing foreign banks to use dollars in transactions with Iran.

Two other Senators, Bob Corker(R-Tenn.) and Ben Cardin (D-Md.) also worked on a bill this week regarding Iran – to step up sanctions. The legislation, according to the Washington Post, would increase penalties for ballistic missiles and conventional weapons, and renew the Iran Sanctions Act.
