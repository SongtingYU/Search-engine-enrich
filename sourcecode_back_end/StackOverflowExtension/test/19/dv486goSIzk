Description:

The animal kingdom is a vast variety of different animals. From cats to reptiles to sea creatures, there is so much to appreciate and admire from animals that we seldom think about the human impact on their survival. The list of endangered species is growing by the day, and we are losing some of the most beautiful animals that have ever existed due to overhunting, drought, manipulating nature, and uses of chemicals. When exposed, several animals today have been born with genetic mutations that cause deformities and physical mutations that defy the laws of biology and physics. If there are no chemicals or nuclear plants present, there have been cases of man trying to cross breed different species for the purposes of creating new animals. Dogs are notorious victims of this practice, which is why we now have “designer” dogs that were never meant to exists.
Sometimes, mutations can go nuts to the point where what is born is completely creepy and sends shivers up all of our spines. We feel both horror and pity towards the animal, and in most cases, the animal isn’t able to survive with the mutations and ends up having to be put out of its misery. While some of the stories can be tragic, there are also survival stories that are both incredible and inspiring, even if the animal still manages to creep us out and make us really uncomfortable. Here are stories of creepy mutated animals that you won’t believe are real and not photoshopped.
