Test your brain with this amazing brain test! Now, you might wonder... why am I being shown some animals and asked to answer "what's this?". That's because your brain needs to be distracted before doing the test. So this test is very simple. It ask you ONE question, to which most people say the same thing. If you answer correctly, that means that you thing like MOST other people. This is to say your brain has been tested and trained to think similar. However, if you answer something other than NY, then you definitely fall out of the crowd and "think differently". That can be a good thing!

I hope you like this brain test. Maybe some others would have called it mind test or IQ test or somehting, but I think it just tests your brain. Have fun, and check out my other videos! :)
