How to make an emergency spare key. This tutorial shows you how to make a print of an original padlock key, and transfer it onto the lid of a food can. You can then cut out your own DIY spare key and use it to unlock your padlock. You might want to use pliers and safety gloves to do this project, and please be careful not to cut yourself.
