Philosopher Alan Watts tries to describe the answer to our existence but in doing so he helps us understand the answer cannot be found. He can only say that existence is simply weird. Watts believes our lives are the ‘odd’ standing out of the flat, ‘even,’ unknowable background. The unanswerable nature of the existence question is what will forever make humans wonder. The only thing we can say with certainty is that existence is indeed weird.
