So apparently, being almost entirely random and independent from what you wear is intentional. And this is how you withstand attacks without breaking form.

The quotation marks in my title are the words from a Namco Bandai Spokesperson responding to Kotaku's Patrick Keplek. According to the same article, linked below, poise is a "situational stat, which seems to be the reason for the confusion"

To which I say bollocks. The reason for the confusion seems to either be a broken stat which FROM and Namco Bandai are not owning up to (and it's not like that is without precedent. Most remember how durability was ALSO "working as intended" in Dark Souls 2) or and obscure system that does not work at all as is mentioned in the stat explanations and numerous item descriptions. At the very least, an explanation of the system and a correction of the misleading information is required. Also,  that explanation does not explain exactly why enemies like the Cathedral knight above do have a poise system in place, working just like that of Dark souls 1.

Also worthy of mention, according to the reddit thread below, Namco admitted to there being a "problem" with the poise value. The email featured is legit, but we should take the information with a grain of salt. the reply could have been given by an uninformed helpdesk employee for all we know.
