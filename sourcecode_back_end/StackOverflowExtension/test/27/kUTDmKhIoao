After our reviews of the Google Pixel and Pixel XL found the phones to be excellent overall, but slightly lacking in their ability to hold a charge, we decided to put the two together in a vs battery test. 

For this test we decided to combine different elements of a potential day's battery life in one test - browsing, gaming and youtube watching (if the phones got that far). Let us know what you think of combining these tests in one!

1. Both phones on full brightness
2. Both phones connected to same Wi-Fi
3. Bluetooth off
4. 1 hour 30 minutes for browsing - 1:30 for YouTube - 1:30 for Real Racing
5. No other background apps open - from restart

Pixel - Hour 1:30 - 49% / Hour 3 - 27% / Hour 3:51 - Died

Pixel XL - Hour 1:30 - 56% / Hour 3 - 39% / Hour 4:29 - Died
