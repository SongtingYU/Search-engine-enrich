"Imagination is more important than knowledge" - Albert Einstein

Our imagination and everyday preferences can also tell us a lot about ourselves. Everyday, we see the sky above us, whether it be a crisp, morning sky or a star filled, dark night sky. In this video, you are asked the strange question of 'imagine your ideal sky' - the more detailed, the more imaginative you are. This video is for entertainment purposes only.
