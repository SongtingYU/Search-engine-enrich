**CLARIFICATION: As some have said in the comments, and as the way I phrased it initially was somewhat misleading: no, this isn't exactly how Ron Grainer would have "wanted" the theme to sound in 1963 (not least because it includes instruments that didn't actually exist then), but what it it *is* is the first time he himself had actually fully arranged a version of it, and so it's a lot closer to his own usual style/sound than the 1963 version (or indeed any other subsequent recordings) was/were.

ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION:
While Ron Grainer usually gets most of the credit for the Doctor Who theme tune, it was the arrangement work of Delia Derbyshire and the BBC Radiophonic Workshop that made it the haunting, memorable, distinctive classic that it's rightly lauded as. Grainer may have composed the tune, but had he been left to his own devices, would have arranged it very differently.

On the album "The Exciting Television Music of Ron Grainer" (1980), we finally got to hear what Grainer would have done with the theme. And this is it.
