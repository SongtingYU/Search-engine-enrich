As promised, here's my new mix! Liquid drum and bass has been one of my favorite genres for years now so it was about time to make my first long dnb mix for the channel. The mix mainly concentrates on the same melodic and smooth side of drum and bass I usually feature on the channel. Not much else to say about it other than I love all the tracks, some of them were found in the early days of the channel while others were found just recently but will be played over and over again.

Be sure to download the tracks you enjoy and follow the artists on their social networks, they deserve all the support they get and more. If you have any ideas for future mixes or other thoughts, let me know in the comments!
