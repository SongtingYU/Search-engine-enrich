The Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) has removed 7 of its members considered rebels and allies of the Jubilee Party from the national assembly committees. In a move aimed at enforcing discipline in the orange party, the 7 lawmakers have been de-whipped and will be replaced by loyalists within 14 days. But as Francis Gachuri reports, the errant legislators have termed the move an act of cowardice and dared party leader Raila Odinga to expel them.
