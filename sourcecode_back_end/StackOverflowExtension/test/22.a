One way is to use [Kivy][1]:

&gt; Open source Python library for rapid development of applications
that make use of innovative user interfaces, such as multi-touch apps.

&lt;/br&gt;

&gt;Kivy runs on Linux, Windows, OS X, Android and iOS. You can run the same [python] code on all supported platforms.
