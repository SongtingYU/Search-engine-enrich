Iâ€™m interested in the idea of ownership - for example in relation to time, in the triviality of certain objects and mass production.
I was intrigued by this prehistoric flint hand axe because it incorporates a commonness whilst at the same time it is a very personal and specific object. This tool carries the shape of its owners hand; it refers to its utility and to its invisible user.

I had this prehistoric tool scanned by a 3D-scanner and the video work shows this scanning-process. Even though we reproduce endlessly, every object - copy or original - I believe has its own entity and will live through time. This object from the past contains the future whilst the object from the future contains the past.
