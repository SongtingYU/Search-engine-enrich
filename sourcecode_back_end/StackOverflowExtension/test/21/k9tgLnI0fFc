LYRICS:
I think it’s about time that I walk away, walk away
So I turn around to walk away but then I look back
Sad lady make me turn and walk away again

Even though it looks like it’s the future
It’s really a long, long, time ago
When there were knights
And they got into fights
Using sabers of light
Please remember
Even though some things look so familiar
They’re not really on Earth
Yeah, it’s a galaxy far, far away
Alien DNA walking ‘round every day
And no one notices

Well, I messed up
Yeah, I made a mistake
I can’t sleep
Have to find your place soon
My tailor’s awesome
All the people looking
Rolling like I’m platinum
You know I’ve gone a long way to 
change my mind about us since I seen you
But I’m talking at my robot as you mill about the city
And I’m on my way
Girl, there’s something that you need to know

Even though it looks like it’s the future
It’s really a long, long, time ago
When there were knights
And they got into fights
Using sabers of light
Just remember
Even though some things look so familiar
They’re not really on Earth
Yeah, it’s a galaxy far, far away
Alien DNA walking ‘round every day
And no one notices

Ahhhh, space station blown away
(It’s not the future)
Ahhhh, floating in the diaper tank
(It’s not the future)
Ahhhh, space leprechaun fade away
(It’s not the future)
Ahhhh, cyborg with no big boy words to say
(It’s not the future)

Get turnt
Get real turnt
Get turnt
Get, get real turnt

Well I’m a jaywalker
Got a lot of fresh damage, oh no
I can’t always be around to
Explore foreign love
Overflowing for your love
At night I’m sure that when we argue
makes me dream about those demon fishies
It’s not the way that it’s meant to be and
I bless your outfit
Mmmm, that’s a good choice
What is he saying? I don’t understand
Listen girl
I hope the heartbreak leaves me on the weekend

Even though it looks like it’s the future
It’s really a long, long, time ago
When there were knights
And they got into fights
Using sabers of light
Just remember
Even though some things look so familiar
They’re not really on Earth
Yeah, it’s a galaxy far, far away
Alien DNA walking ‘round every day

It’s a place where
Little furry creatures dance but they’re not teddy bears
They’re an alien equivalent
And they may rage in familiar trees
But it’s not the Redwoods you see
Alien trees on an alien moon, oh-oh
It’s something else indeed
Alien trees on an alien moon, oh-oh
Time to break it down
Break it down, down, down, down

Yeah, I was big in Japan
I was king of Ping Pong
Yeah I was bad at tuba
And I’m sure you’d like me to bounce
Master, I need one of these
Do they come in threes?
‘cause I need to squeeze them
Yeahhh
Yeah, I was big in Japan
I was king of Ping Pong
Yeah I was bad at tuba
And I’m sure you’d like me to bounce

Sometimes that moment when you wish you could run and hide
Is when you find you need a new hyperdrive
We all sometimes wish we could get away
And if you try
Then you gotta just make sure if you hide in a cave that it’s
Really not some giant space snake

Even though it looks like it’s the future
It’s really a long, long, time ago
When there were knights
And they got into fights
Using sabers of light
Just remember
Even though some things look so familiar
They’re not really on Earth
Yeah, it’s a galaxy far, far away
Alien DNA walking ‘round every day
And no one notices

Even though it looks like it’s the future
It’s really a long, long, time ago
When there were knights
And they got into fights
Using sabers of light
Just remember
Even though some things look so familiar
They’re not really on Earth
Yeah, it’s a galaxy far, far away
Alien DNA walking ‘round every day
And no one notices

Get turnt
Get real turnt
Get turnout
Get, get real turnt
It’s not the future
Get turnt
Get real turnt
Get turnt
Get, get real turnt
It’s not the future
