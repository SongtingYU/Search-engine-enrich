To know which tribe each contestant belonged to, the Warriors had to 'Dig For Tribes'. Twelve boxes were buried underneath a swampy field and each contestant had to dig up a box which contained either a yellow or red object. This they did with their bare hands. Those whose boxes contained red objects belonged to the Spears and would stay in the Red camp while those with yellow objects belonged to the Swords camp. All dug up their boxes except Martha who gave up.

The members of the Swords are: Edmond Umebuani, Ezidi Bobby Nzube, Sheidu Onozare Halima, Chapele Tracy, Salako Oladimeji Olukunle and Mary Adeboye. The Spears consist of: Okike Dennis, Brosu Anthony, Ifunanya Onike Michelle, Ijeh Peter Oseleka, Etido Ema Ebong and Martha Adeboye 

Edmond was chosen as the leader of Swords Tribe while Anthony became the leader of Spears Tribe. The contestants were informed there was a five-star accommodation which they had to battle over, playing 'Mudby' made popular in Season 9. The losing team would camp in the 'slum' while the winning team would abode in a camp of luxury.Â
