From the module set "Object-Oriented Methods".

Object Orientation provides a way of representing the elements, behaviours and data of the business world as objects that interact with one another in support of a business function or process.  The modular and self contained nature of object orientation helps to localise the impact of change across the system.
This fundamental change to software development will make the software systems that you design and build using Object principles and technologies far easier for your IT project teams and businesses to:

    * Develop and deploy;
    * Change and maintain;
    * Understand and use by the business and operational communities.

Object Orientation is an equally applicable approach to describing and creating real-time systems such as those found in flight control and telephony networks.
