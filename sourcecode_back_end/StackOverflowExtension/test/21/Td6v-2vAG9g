SCP Containment Breach is a first person horror game developed by Joonas Rikkonen.  The player is put in the world of the SCP Foundation, where various anomalous objects and beings are kept contained in an underground facility.  The main protagonist, the player, must escape the facility after a failure with testing occurred, releasing all of the SCP's in the facility.  This is called a containment breach, hence the name.

Today I will show all of the SCPs that are currently in SCP Containment Breach!
