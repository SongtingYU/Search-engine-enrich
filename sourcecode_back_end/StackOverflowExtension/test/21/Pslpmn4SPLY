AN UPDATED, SHORTER VERSION OF THIS VIDEO WAS UPLOADED ON 7.8.14. VIEW IT HERE http://youtu.be/gkAN7BInUAI.

Create your own cupcake wrappers to match your decor! This tutorial walks step by step through how to create a cupcake wrapper template, make a decorative edge, adhere it, and tweak it. It also discusses what to do about wrapping cupcakes where the oil seeps through the liner.

NOTE: As you will read in the comments, there is a lot of talking in this video (I was new to Youtube demos). It is all relevant and gives detailed information on the project (that some feel is useful and some feel is way too much :-). But there is good info here. FYI - I will be doing a revised version of this video (without so much talking) the first week of July 2014! Enjoy!
