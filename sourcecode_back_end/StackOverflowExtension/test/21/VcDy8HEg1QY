Lyrics:

If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eye Joe 
I'd been married long time ago 
Where did you come from where did you go 
Where did you come from Cotton-Eye Joe 

He came to town like a midwinter storm 
He rode through the fields so handsome and strong 
His eyes was his tools and his smile was his gun 
But all he had come for was having some fun
