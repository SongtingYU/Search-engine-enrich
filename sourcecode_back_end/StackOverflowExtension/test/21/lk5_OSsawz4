LYRICS:

[Close Encounters of the Droid Kind]
You must use the Force
You must use the Force
(repeat ad nauseam)
You must use the Force

[Raiders of the Lost Wookiee]
Time ago, far, far away
Long time ago, far, far away
Kiss a Wookiee, kick a droid!
Fly the Falcon through an asteroid!
Till the princess is annoyed!
This is spaceships,
It's monsters,
It's Star Wars,
We love it!
Come and help me,
Obi-Wan
X-wing fighter
And a blaster gun!
Dance with Ewoks,
Oh, what fun!
This is spaceships,
It's monsters,
It's Star Wars,
We love it!

[Super Han]
Get in there you big, furry oaf
I couldn't care less what you smell!
I take orders from only me
Maybe you'd like it back in your cell
Your Highness, your worshipfulness,
Your Highness, your worshipfulness!
No one cares if you upset a droid
(Nobody cares if you upset a droid)
That's because droids don't tear
your arms out of sockets
(Nobody cares)
I suggest a new strategy:
Let the Wookiee win
That's because nobody cares if you upset a droid

[E.T. - The DiscoTerrestrial]
Now we listen to Luke whining:
One more season... one more season...
One more season... one more season...
I was gonna go to Tosche
Station for power converters
Now I guess I'm going nowhere
It just isn't fair...

[Jaws: The Wookiee]
Woooooookiee
Woooooookiee
Woooooookiee
Woooooookiee
Woooooookiee
Woooooookiee
Someone move this walking carpet
(Woo-kiee! Woo-kiee!)
Someone move this walking carpet
(Woo-kiee! Woo-kiee!)
Kiss your brother, kiss your brother
Princess Leia!
Well, I guess
You don't know anything
About women
Who's your daddy? Who's your daddy?
Who's your daddy? Who's your daddy?

[Jurassic Darth]
Luke, I'm your father
(That's not true!)
It is useless to resist
(My hand!)
Come with me, my son
We will rule!
(I'll never join you!)
Search your feelings, it is true
So, you have a twin sister who
Obi-Wan was wise to hide
(Is that Leia?)
If you will not turn
Then perhaps she will
Give in to your hate,
You are mine

[Close Encounters of the Droid Kind - Reprise]
(Long, long, long time ago...)
Far, far, far, far away
Long, long, long time ago,
Far, far, far away!
Kiss a Wookiee, (kiss a Wookiee)
Kick a droid! (kick a droid!)
Fly the Falcon (fly the Falcon)
Through an asteroid!
Till the princess (till the princess)
is annoyed!
(She's annoyed!)
This is spaceships,
It's monsters,
It's Star Wars,
We love it, it's true!
Episode III
Coming to you
2005
So let's go
(Go, go, go to the movies)
Stand in line
(Buy, buy, buy me some popcorn)
Cause it's al-
(Please, I'd like extra butter)
-most the time!
(JOIN THE DARK SIDE)
May the Force be with you all!
JOHN WILLIAMS IS THE MAN!
