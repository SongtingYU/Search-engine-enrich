From sculptures so small you can't see them fully in normal light to motors that can fit inside a human cell we look at 5 of the Smallest Things & Man Made Objects in the World.

Nano Sculptures
The sculptures made by Jonty Hurwitz and his team like this piece called “The Gentle Giant” have now reached such a microscopic scale that they even had to create a new method of filming to show them because  they are so small you cant see the fine details with normal visible light.
You have to remember that this elephant sculpture is just 1/10th of a millimetre high and yet you can still see the fine details of the wrinkles on the skin.
This and the other Nano sculptures including “Trust” the worlds smallest sculpture of a woman which is shown standing on a human hair are made using a nano 3D printer technique called Multiphoton lithography.....


Smallest hand made sculptures
Now if you thought that the previous sculptures where pretty amazing then this next one on the list will blow your mind.
Willard Wigan creates the smallest handmade sculpture in the world, figures so small that they can stand in the eye of a needle, in fact the very smallest sculpture he has made is of a motorcycle inside a hollowed out shaft of Willard’s own beard stubble and don’t forget these are made by hand, not by computer or robot or 3D printer but by hand.
These micro works of art sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars and collectors include the likes of Prince Charles, Elton John, Simon Cowell and Mike Tyson......

Smallest motor
We’ve seen nano motors before but now Cockrell School of Engineering at the University of Texas has created a motor under 1 micrometer in size which is 500 times smaller than a grain of salt and small enough to fit inside a human cell.
Now that’s pretty amazing but this nano sized motor is capable of run for up 15 continuous hours at 18,000 revolutions per minute, that’s the speed of a turbine in a jet engine. 
The power come from an induced DC current to assemble the 3 part motor and AC current to operate them.
The motor has been successfully designed, assembled and tested in a non-biological environment, and has performed three tasks....


Smallest computer
We are used to seeing computers getting smaller and more powerful but the biggest stumbling block to creating truly tiny computers it that whilst the physical components can be shrunk the power required was still high, so a tiny computer would need a big battery in comparison.
The breakthrough came in 2008 when the Phoenix processor was created which used a fraction of the power of previous processors and allowed much smaller self-contained computers to be created.
The Michigan Micro Mote is currently the world’s smallest computer at just 2mm x 4mm and requires an average of just 500 pico watts in operation and just 35 pico watts in standby or about a millionth of the power of a mobile phone on standby.
The Michigan Micro Mote has a processor, a radio for wifi communications, a solar cell and battery for power, a photocell for communications and can have a variety of sensors like pressure, temperature, imaging etc making the Micro Mote a fully self-contained computer that can run on just the normal lighting in a room.....


Smallest Flying Robot
Ever since the beginning of their existence, the makers of robots have taken inspiration from nature whether that’s in the form of man or of nature's other wonders like the insects. 
Up until recently Technological limitations have prevented robots from matching the size of the real life insects.
Robobee has been 14 years in the making, when it was first announced, it could fly for just a few seconds before crashing. 
Now it can hover along a pre-set flight path and recently the team at Harvard have shown that they can get it to also swim under water using a modified flapping technique which was inspired by the Puffins ability to go from flying to swimming as they dive for fish.
The micro robot which is 2cm in length and weighs just 80 mg still has to fly with a tether to provide it power because there are still no batteries small enough to fit, yet powerful enough to make it fly.
