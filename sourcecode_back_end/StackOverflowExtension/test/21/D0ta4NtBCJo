In this week's episode of Crafty Friday, I show you many different ways to decorate your notebooks for Back To School. You can doodle, use duct tape, recycle crayon wrappers // paint samples, cut pages from magazines, add a Rainbow Loom charm, or even turn your spiral into a chalkboard! Plus, I have a design for a The Fault In Our Stars. Check back next Crafty Friday for a new how to video from SoCraftastic. Oh, and don't forget to subscribe! Please & thanks. :)
