DISCLAIMER: We post to this channel in order to share our evidence of the paranormal. We are still UNCERTAIN if the song contained in this video holds a CURSE. Given our current lack of evidence please PROCEED WITH CAUTION. 

We've quickly learned that the scariest and best cases we take on, are the ones we stumble into or worse yet, the ones that stumble on us. Such is the case with what I believe is some kind of cursed pop song. We're not sure of how the song works, but we know there's something dark and disturbing under the surface of the song. Meanwhile we agree to take a look at a young man's strange haunted object... a toaster...

Best,
C.W.
