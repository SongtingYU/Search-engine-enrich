How to reuse candy wrappers to make butterfly's and bows.

I have missed making this little videos and my I plan is to make it a weekly project for 2015 and hopefully it will help grow my skills in video making. On my website http://annacarinsol.com I have a gallery page for reused items come on over and share your project with me!

If you like what you see don't forget to push the follow/like buttons! Thanks for watching!
Blessings!
