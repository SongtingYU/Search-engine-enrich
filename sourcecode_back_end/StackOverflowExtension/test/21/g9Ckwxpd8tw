Whats your favorite candy? I've always had a sweet tooth for Kit Kat's, but now a day I have to hold myself back from eating too many sweets!! 

I found these Green Tea Kit Kats in Little Tokyo in Los Angeles. They we're pretty good since it combined two of  my favorite things; Kit Kats and Green Tea. I know there are different Kit Kat flavors around the world. I recently found out there are Wasabi flavored Kit Kats!? I haven't had them but I'm very curious to see what they taste like. If you would like to send me Kit Kats feel free to forward them to my P.O. Box!! I would be more than happy so give you guys a should in my next update video!!
