Recently, the BBC did a great series called 'A History of the World in 100 Objects', which used objects from the British Museum's collection to highlight key stages in human history.  As a way of capturing some of the stories contained in 'The Transition Companion' we have made 10 short films that try to capture "A Story of Transition in 10 Objects" (you can see the various dates associated with the book's release here).   
They present various items from different Transition initiatives as though they were precious museum artifacts, and tell their stories.  Here's the first.
