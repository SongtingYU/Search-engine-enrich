Class is a user-defined data structure, which acts as the blueprint for creating objects. Understand that in OOP paradigm an object acts as a building-block in a  program structure. Understand that whereas a class is a blueprint, the Objects created from it, are real things. Every noun in the world can be defined as an Object. For creating an Object, the essential prerequisite is creating class.
 Every class is a self-contained entity, with an unique identifiable name, which contains data members and functions, which can act upon the data members.
