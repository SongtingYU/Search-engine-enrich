<p>I have a dictionary of values read from two fields in a database: a string field and a numeric field. The string field is unique, so that is the key of the dictionary.</p>

<p>I can sort on the keys, but how can I sort based on the values?</p>

<p>Note: I have read Stack Overflow question <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/72899">How do I sort a list of dictionaries by values of the dictionary in Python?</a> and probably could change my code to have a list of dictionaries, but since I do not really need a list of dictionaries I wanted to know if there is a simpler solution.</p>
