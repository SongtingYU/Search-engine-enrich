I'm not trying to call anyone out in this video... except for Lex's bitch ass on that ridiculously stupid title... but for real - just trying to highlight some of the better stuff about Call of Duty that I feel like a lot of people, including myself sometimes are forgetting. And I mean really Lex, its not even clickbaity, it just flat out doesnt make sense to me. (jokes I love Lex). Lol, does anyone even read this stuff?
