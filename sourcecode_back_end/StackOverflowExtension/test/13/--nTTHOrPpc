Hey Youtube!! I made this video to show how I make my prints from start to finish. I wish I could have shown more detail when I edited the image in photoshop, for some reason my screen capture didn't show any of the editing windows. I mostly used Levels and Hue/Saturation and the tools I used were just the crop, paint brush, healing brush, and the transform tool. 
Here are the products I used:
Printer/Scanner:   Canon Pixma mg6820 
  - I also use a Epson Stylus Photo 1400 for my large format prints
Wacom Tablet: Intuos 3 Large
Adobe Photoshop CS6
Paper:   I use Moab Lasal Matte paper for the BEST quality,
but there are some more affordable paper brands like the Office Depot Premium Matte Photo paper and Epson paper as well.

This print is available in my shop here: http://jacquelindeleon.storenvy.com/products/17758598-lavender-witch-print
