This episode is part of a VI High series focusing on arrays that runs from VI High 24-32.

In VI High 24 we built some simple arrays. Now we're going to take the next few episodes to look at some common array functions with 1-D and 2-D arrays. We've cut the episode length down to be bite-sized, digestible, and tasty. Bon appetit!
