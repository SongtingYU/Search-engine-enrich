How to Make a Minecraft Obsidian Pillar End City! What do you do with the end once you've killed the ender dragon? Well, I have the challenge for you: turn it into a city! In this video i teach you how to make towers and platforms. I'm not sure if this is a transformation video or a community project like the jungle one.
