Miku does sound innocent. Another wonderful append sweet song from U-skeP. I'm starting to like his works. His previous work includes Rain*Sweet*Umbrella http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq2971oPK_U

*I just found U-skeP's age. He was born in 1988 September. Age 21-22? Blood type AB. I'm such a stalker xD
