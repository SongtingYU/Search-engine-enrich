in this video, the vocals is not the original...i just googled an instrumental version then made a vsq..

I tried to look for its vsq in the net, but i wasn't able to find one..so i just made my own ^^

Anyway, here it is (the VSQ):

no need to credit me, as long as you don't declare yourself as the one who made it.
But in case you wanna credit, just linking to this video or to my channel would suffice ^___^

thankies for the appreciation

ANOTHER EDIT:
to those asking for the picture, I cannot put the link on the comments, so I'll just post it here in the description...

http://himawarifreya.blogspot.com/2011/05/konbanwa-hotamori-disini.html

that's the blog where I got it. I didn't put the direct link to the picture so as to give proper credit (at least as proper as I can).
