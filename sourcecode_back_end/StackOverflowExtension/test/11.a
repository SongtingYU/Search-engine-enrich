Python 2.7.9+ and 3.4+
----------------------

Good news! [Python 3.4][1] (released March 2014) and [Python 2.7.9][2] (released December 2014) ship with Pip. This is the best feature of any Python release. It makes the community&#39;s wealth of libraries accessible to everyone. Newbies are no longer excluded from using community libraries by the prohibitive difficulty of setup. In shipping with a package manager, Python joins [Ruby][3], [Node.js][4], [Haskell][5], [Perl][6], [Go][7]--almost every other contemporary language with a majority open-source community. Thank you Python.

Of course, that doesn&#39;t mean Python packaging is problem solved. The experience remains frustrating. I discuss this [in Stack Overflow question *Does Python have a package/module management system?*][8].

And, alas for everyone using Python 2.7.8 or earlier (a sizable portion of the community). There&#39;s no plan to ship Pip to you. Manual instructions follow.

Python 2 ≤ 2.7.8 and Python 3 ≤ 3.3
-----------------------------------

Flying in the face of its [&#39;batteries included&#39;][9] motto, Python ships without a package manager. To make matters worse, Pip was--until recently--ironically difficult to install.

### Official instructions

Per http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html:

Download [`get-pip.py`][10], being careful to save it as a `.py` file rather than `.txt`. Then, run it from the command prompt:

    python get-pip.py

You possibly need an administrator command prompt to do this. Follow *[Start a Command Prompt as an Administrator][11]* (Microsoft TechNet).


### Alternative instructions

The official documentation tells users to install Pip and each of its dependencies from source. That&#39;s tedious for the experienced, and prohibitively difficult for newbies.

For our sake, Christoph Gohlke prepares Windows installers (`.msi`) for popular Python packages. He builds installers for all Python versions, both 32 and 64 bit. You need to

1. [Install setuptools][12]
2. [Install pip][13]

For me, this installed Pip at `C:\Python27\Scripts\pip.exe`. Find `pip.exe` on your computer, then add its folder (for example, `C:\Python27\Scripts`) to your path (Start / Edit environment variables). Now you should be able to run `pip` from the command line. Try installing a package:

    pip install httpie

There you go (hopefully)! Solutions for common problems are given below:

### Proxy problems

If you work in an office, you might be behind a HTTP proxy. If so, set the environment variables [`http_proxy` and `https_proxy`][14]. Most Python applications (and other free software) respect these. Example syntax:

    http://proxy_url:port
    http://username:password@proxy_url:port

If you&#39;re really unlucky, your proxy might be a Microsoft [NTLM][15] proxy. Free software can&#39;t cope. The only solution is to install a free software friendly proxy that forwards to the nasty proxy. http://cntlm.sourceforge.net/

### Unable to find vcvarsall.bat

Python modules can be part written in C or C++. Pip tries to compile from source. If you don&#39;t have a C/C++ compiler installed and configured, you&#39;ll see this cryptic error message.

&gt; Error: Unable to find vcvarsall.bat

You can fix that by [installing a C++ compiler][16] such as [MinGW][17] or [Visual C++][18]. Microsoft actually ship one specifically for use with Python. Or try *[Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7][19]*.

Often though it&#39;s easier to check [Christoph&#39;s site][20] for your package.
