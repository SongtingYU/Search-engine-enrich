Welcome to my let's play and walkthrough of Albino Lullaby It is a indie horror game which promises to scare you without relying on jumpscares and focusing on a creepy atmosphere. So far the surreal art style and the atmosphere is pretty cool and disturbing, this playthrough is definitely gonna be cringe worthy!
Synopsis:
Albino Lullaby is a horror adventure game that doesn't rely on jump scares or gore. A Lynchian psychological nightmare where you play as yourself. Escape from a dark and surreal Victorian town that clings to the precipices of underground cliffs. The gamespace dynamically twists and contorts around you in real time, as you unravel an equally twisted narrative. Discover the hidden spaces haunted by 'The Grandchildren' as you uncover clues to understanding just where and what you are. Albino Lullaby is set for initial release on the PC and will be fully VR compatible.
