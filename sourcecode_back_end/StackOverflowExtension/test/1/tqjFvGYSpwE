HD FOR JARED LETO EVERYWHERE

For: Noncielo
Theme: "A modern twist on your favorite God/Goddess/fictional entity."
Plot: "In the Greek myth, Procrustes was a son of Poseidon with a stronghold on Mount Korydallos at Erineus, on the sacred way between Athens and Eleusis. There he had an iron bed, in which he invited every passer-by to spend the night, and where he set to work on them with his smith's hammer, to stretch them to fit. In later tellings, if the guest proved too tall, Procrustes would amputate the excess length; nobody ever fit the bed exactly, because secretly Procrustes had two beds. Procrustes continued his reign of terror until he was captured by Theseus, travelling to Athens along the sacred way, who "fitted" Procrustes to his own bed." 
For me Procuste is totally trapped inside his own reflexion. It's impossible, useless and it will never end. That's why, in my 'modern twisted version' of Procuste he just can get away of his own reflection. And he's afraid of it. And tired.

With Jared Leto as Procuste â™¥ 
I love the ironie of the stuff. 'Cause Procuste is the myth of conformism. and Jared is everything but this.
