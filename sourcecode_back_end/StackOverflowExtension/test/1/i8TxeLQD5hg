[Martial Arts Battle Arena Kai]
Fight in a martial arts battle arena and progress through the belt levels from white belt up to black belt.

[Updates]
Added extra push for punch and particularly kicks, both with a chance of doing bonus push and damage on head and torso, more so for heads and kicks. Made timing more spot-on, added little gap after damage time so your opponent can counter at the end of your technique as the animation plays a little longer.
Fixed energy drain issue when not jumping
Added jump-stopper outside of match
Fixed game relying on backup fix every round
Fixed Wall cancollide issues, on spawn and random breaks
Fi
