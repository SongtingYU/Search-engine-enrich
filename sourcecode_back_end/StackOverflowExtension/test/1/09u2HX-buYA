Summary:

Become the Legend, they say!  No way we will include others out of Valoran, they say!  And its true (Well, the islands outside of Valoran isn't, LOL!) to what the League of Legends is here to give you all: A Legend that you will remember!!

Graphics are being redesigned, as well as the balance being tweaked around as each update is released.  No other way to explain it, although there could be a bit of more balancing, since some heroes can still overkill others given the right situations to the attacker/defender.  The overall Gameplay is just phenomenal!  There is just one problem with it, and that is it just needs an in-game voice system, just like [Ghost Recon Online], in which people can easily communicate to each other rather than be typing to the team with vague symbols like "SS" or "b" or "re".  What do those mean anyways, critics?  Anyways, moving on.

The stories of each and every heroes are interesting to read, although the newer ones seem to be running out of ideas and relying on other pop culture from the internet and the world (Xerath = That kid who repeatedly yelled: "Lightning Bolt", Ahri = "My Girlfriend is a Ghumiho").  I just kind of wished that the League could have more of an impact in the world of Valoran rather than just be there to settle minor disputes that eventually come back to haunt the rest of the people living in that small continent of the world.  Additionally, Valoran shouldn't be the only continent of the entire globe of the earth?  I often wonder if there are other continents around the world surrounding o-small Valoran in this vast globe...!?  Only time will tell, right critics?

Speaking of [worldly disputes], why are there no other maps than "Summoner's Rift" and "Crystal Scar" in the game!?  Its like as if the summoners from all around the world are ultimately sheltered in their "Institute of War," afraid of starting up other nexuses around the world to do battle...   If this game would focus more on the land of Valoran becoming battlefields and the possible stages it can provide rather than heroes, then I believe that this game could be more balanced than where it is now (Focused on Heroes, no maps).

Replay Value, omg...  I just can't explain in detail that much...  All I can say is: Get a guide, play with it, understand it thoroughly, then try breaking from it in terms of runes/masteries/items.  The character that you choose has different paths, or builds if you love to be specific, that they could take to be useful in the battles to come.  Just a lot of ways to build, whether from guides, experience, experimentation, or a mix of all those three by the player him/herself.

Overall, I recommend you reviewers of this game to try out the game, despite the problem that [Ghost Recon Online] has (Experienced Players owning the New Gen Players).  The replay value is high, graphics are being redone (waiting for dat Yi Redesign), and the balance is fairly general to its perceived reputation it holds in today's time.  Give it a shot, and you may or may not like it.  Just.... watch out for those true nuubs that want to report you because of stuff that you try to do your best at, kay~!!

This is Yasashi Tsu-Kun, signing out...  Peace off, viewers!
