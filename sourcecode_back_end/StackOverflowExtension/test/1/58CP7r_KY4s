10k sub special! What's special about this video you may ask? 1) It's the first OTK video I've uploaded whilst having a 5 digit sub count. 2) Isn't that enough :P Something new I'm trying in this video is showing you all of the failed attempts at pulling off the OTK, in the order of failure, and believe me this time there were many. I wanted to get the OTK recorded before going to sleep, you can't say I didn't at least try ;)

This 30 damage OTK doesn't require the use of Emperor Thaurissan or Aviana, but it does require an empty enemy board if you want the full 30 damage to reliably hit face (15 damage is targeted at a random enemy). An empty enemy board is the killer, how often is that true at the start of your turn?

Cards used: Eydis Darkbane, Charge, Inner Rage x2, Rampage x2

Skip to 1:35 for the OTK turn.
Skip to 2:20 for the successful decklist. WARNING: Do not try this at home ;)
Skip to 2:26 for the failed attempts
Skip to 9:41 to have a bad time*

Hearthstone is an online collectible card game created by Blizzard, with PvP and PvE content themed around World of Warcraft. OTK refers to one turn kill, a special form of gameplay where you can kill the opponent in a single turn, without relying on minions or weapons on board from a previous turn. OTKs are rarely viable in competitive gameplay, but as the flashy trickshots of the Hearthstone world, they are very entertaining.

*Yes an Undertale reference, deal with it :P
