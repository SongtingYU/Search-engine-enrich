Starting Out With C++ From Control Structures Through Objects
C++ Programming Challenge 7-16: 2 Dimensional Array Operations

In this video I demonstrate how C++ 2 Dimensional Arrays work, how to manipulate rows and columns of the array, and how to pass 2D arrays into functions as arguments.

Write a program that creates a two dimensional array initialized with test data. Use any data type you wish. The program should have the following:
- getTotal. This function accepts a 2D array and returns total of all the values in the array.
- getAverage. Accepts 2D array, returns average of all values
- getRowTotal. Accepts 2D array, and an integer. The second argument should be the subscript of a row in the array. Returns the total of that row.
- getColumnTotal. Accepts 2D array, and an integer. The second argument should be the subscript of the row in the array. Returns total of that column
- getHighestInRow. Accepts 2D array and integer. Returns highest value in that row.
- getLowestInRow. Accepts 2D array and integer. Returns lowest value in that row
