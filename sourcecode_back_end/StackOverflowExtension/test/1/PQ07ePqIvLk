 When the names Eryo and Kay-D are invloved in a project you know the results will likely be spectacular and with their new single 'Meridian' they certainly are. Eryo and Kay-D's original mix is an amazing piece of lush progressive house. The bassline has a nice pulse and warm to it, the pads and atmosphere that sweep in and out of the mix are simply gorgeous. Ultimately it's the emotion evoking key changes and very intricate work on the sound design that do it here, so many of the finer details created have an unparalled earthy quality to them that give the piece an organic and timeless feel. Definitely not overproduced, these two know how much is just enough and the track is brilliant.

 The very fast rising and ultra talented Blusoul provides a sublime melodic breaks interpretation. He has kept the spirit and vibe of the original which is a great thing cause the remix has turned out really classy and is a great compliment to the package. Loquai also provides a breaks remix, his interpretation keeps the track pretty stripped until the breakdown where the melodic elements are introduced. Loquai's mix never gets too over the top, really relying on it's fat bottom end and just hints of the melodic to really deliver a nice alternative to Blusoul's outstanding blissed out version. To close the package Elfsong has come up with a monster progressive trance mix. We've been fans of Elfsong for quite some time, one of the best producers around for the progressive trance sound. The production on this mix is absolutely outstanding and takes the mix in a much bigger more dancefloor oriented direction which is a really great compliment to the classic and timeless sounding original. Awesome stuff from Eryo, Kay-D and the Mistique family.
