I DO NOT OWN THIS SONG, OR THE ART. This song belongs entirely to Trip Lee, and His crew at Reach Records. :)

Yo, hope you all doing fine this lovely day :). Firstly want to say thanks for listening to this song, and secondly, I hope that you are hearing what Trip is saying. No Worries. Think about it, coz there's so much stuff in this world which can get you stressed out, like maybe exams, or a job, or finance, yet Trip is saying NO WORRIES. Man this guy must be nuts you're probably saying. Either that, or He's relying on someone pretty powerful to look after His needs. Jesus is His name my friends :). He loves you so much, He really does. He gave up His life, to give us all life. I hope you find yourself putting all your worries at His feet, because He made this universe, and all that comes with it, and if you trust in Him, He WILL be on your side. Imagine having like this massive God, right next to you, so that whenever you face troubles, He can just give them a flick with His finger, and their gone. You'd be some team :P, hard to beat. That's how it can be. Just trust God in everything, even if the situation looks dim, just trust Him, because God knows more than we ever could. If you have any questions about what I've just said, or about God, please message or comment, and I'll try get back to you asap. :) Much Love
God Bless you all
