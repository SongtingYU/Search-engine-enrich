Marina City - "The Rise and Fall of You" A BlankTV World Premiere!
 
Artist city, country: Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A.
 
Artist Biography: “Marina City is THE Chicago band to watch out for.”* Fusing the aggressive instrumentals found in hard rock with the catchy vocal melodies and harmonies found in top 40 pop, Marina City has set out to create something that has never been heard before. Classifying the genre as Aggressive Pop-Rock, the quintet has released 2 Eps, toured heavily from the Midwest to the East Coast, and has shared the stage with well known and established acts such as Go Radio, Amanda Palmer, State Champs, Cartel, and Real Friends. Since debuting at a sold out House of Blues show, Marina City has taken a strictly DIY approach to their booking and management,. This year their newest EP (Chimera) and the music video for their first single (“The Lost Boys”) was exclusively premiered on AbsolutePunk.net, featured on Pup Fresh, and Property of Zack.
Relying on “poignant lyrics, three-part harmonies, and one hell of a drummer”** the band features lead vocalist Ryan Argast, guitarist and vocalist Brian Johnson, keyboardist and vocalist Matt Gaudiano, drummer Eric Somers-Urrea, and bassist Aaron Heiy. In 2012 the band ventured away from being a solo act behind singer Ryan Argast and become more of a collaborative group walking away from a production deal in the process. With a degree in music performance, drummer Eric Somers-Urrea creates a strong rhythmic backbone for bassist Aaron Heiy’s deep pocket to groove over. Hammond artist Matthew Gaudiano on keys teams up with guitarist Brian Johnson to create the hard-hitting and aggressive center of the band. However, the biggest standout factor for Marina City is that it features 3 lead vocalists. Gaudiano’s smooth R&B style and Johnson’s raw punk sound compliment the power and emotion of frontman Ryan Argast. Said Chris Triebes owner and talent buyer of Mojoes In Joliet, IL "Marina City puts on one of the most energetic & passionate live shows I have seen from a local-area band in a long time" 
*Robbie Mueller, Founder of BTG Management
**Zack Jablow, Grammy award winning producer.
 
About The Video: This song is about being swallowed up in a poisonous relationship and how we wish it would have ended. The video was shot at Kay Studios in Providence Rhode Island in one day while our off day on tour. This is the second single off of our sophomore Ep, Chimera.

Song Lyrics: If it was up to me
You wouldn't have another drink
You wouldn't be drowning in your own misery
If these walls could talk
They'd ask to not spin at all
Maybe just this once you could stand up straight and tall

You said this wouldn't happen again

Just stand on your two feet
Just keep it together
And make me believe
That you can
Stand on your two feet
Just keep it together
And make me believe
That you're not gone

If those loose lips would sink
Just like your dignity
Then we wouldn't mind your company
You're tongue is so tied up
You actually believe your pretty little lies
You're so hung up on your self I hope that rope is tied tight

Do you remember who you are?
Just stay with me
Stay with me now
When a bottle comes to those lips you lose who you are
Just stay with
Stay with me now
The next time you fall I'll walk over you
