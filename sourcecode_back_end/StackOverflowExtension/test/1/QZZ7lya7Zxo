Simus - "Fakir -Факир" Bakerteam Records - A BlankTV World Premiere!
 
Artist city, country: Como, Italy
 
Artist Biography: The SIMUS were formed in the province of Como (Italy) in 2008. From the very beginning one of the main features of the band was to associate their music with other types of artistic expression in order to fully involve the listener-viewer. The songs of the band – difficult to be classified in one sole genre of music, moving among rock, prog and metal, cross different sound worlds in order to create a continuous flow of heterogeneous emotional states. In 2010, in collaboration with Myphonic Records, the band released their first CD “HUMAN PRISON”, registered and mixed by Carlo “Fajo” Girardi from One Black Sock Studio in Turin. In line with proper artistic ideas this first work saw the collaboration with Rosario Chinello, the author of the CD-cover and with the photographer Stefano Simeone, who took care of all the photographic images of the band. The single “Drops and Lies” was included in several compilations, among which the Californian “KILL CITY vol.29”. In the summer of the same year SIMUS participated at Colonia Sonora Festival, sharing the stage with the Americans Coheed and Cambria. In May of 2012 relying on NAFFINTUSI Studio and thanks to the collaboration of the model and actress Ilaria Pozzi, the band released their first music videoclip on the single “PLANET CAIAK”. Great result of the work and the collaboration with Jack Rock Agency gave them a possibility to organize a tour of eight dates in Russia along with Audrey and Rhyme; the tour was followed and documented by the photographer Roberto Casali. Since the first months of 2013 the band is entirely dedicated to the production and recording of the new album “VOX VULT” out on February 2015 on Bakerteam records and preceded by a new videoclip for the song "The Soulmaker" wich will be included in the new album."Vox Vult"has been registered and mixed by Carlo “Fajo” Girardi from One Black Sock Studio in Turin and mastered by Goran Finnberg at Mastering Room AB studio in Göteborg, Sweden.

Song Lyrics: ФАКИР / FAKIR
Жду пока снадобье подействует
Жду пока ненависть разгонит кровь
Все, что случилось, отдает поражением
Но это мой план и так начинается моя вендетта
Вам не стоит пробуждать во мне волка
Я смогу вырвать зубы дракону
Я смогу победить голодных львов 
Я теперь один, мне нечего терять и остается только рисковать
Вам не стоит пробуждать во мне волка, и я вас поражу, как гром во мраке
Я начинаю мой путь по гвоздям
Мой дух летит, но никто этому не верит
Вечер проходит, и я жду решения
Ожидание - Змея извивается внутри меня 
Цена мне известна, и вызов принимается.
