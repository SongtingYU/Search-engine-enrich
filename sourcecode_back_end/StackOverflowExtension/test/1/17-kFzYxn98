The application creates a Quiz and displays a Progress Report. Give a suitable name for your application.

The user enters his/her last name and first name at the beginning of the quiz.

The quiz contains five questions about a hobby, popular music or any other individual interest.
Each question should be a multiple-choice question with two options.
Each question should be worth 20 marks.

When the user answers the question correctly, display a congratulatory message along with the score.

If the user responds to a question incorrectly, display an appropriate message.
The user should be presented with each question continually until it is answered correctly.

The application must keep a track of the number of attempts for each question.
For any question, the user can score:
•  20 marksàfirst attempt
•  10 marksàsecond attempt
•  0 marksàany additional attempt

When the user ends the quiz, the application must display a well-formatted Progress Report (on the screen itself), indicating the following:

- Current date and time
- Full Name of the user
- Marks scored for the quiz
- Percentage score (for e.g. 60/100 would be 60%)
- Number of attempts for each question.

- Current date and time
- Full Name of the user
