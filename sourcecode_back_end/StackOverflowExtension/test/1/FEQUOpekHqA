This tutorial shows how to add new properties to objects using the Python API.

The script starts from one of the Python templates that creates a simple ui panel. 

In the script, existing and new properties are displayed and accessed in the panel.

The example existing properties are the hide property (because it is of type Boolean) and the Z location (because it is numeric and its value is altered in the script).

A new Boolean property is added, this is used as a switch and will toggle the value of a text object between off and on.

A new integer property is added to store the zlayer setting. Whereas the  z location is a float value making it continuous, the zlayer being integer means that it goes up in steps.

The tutorial shows how to link update functions to the new properties that are run when the properties change.
