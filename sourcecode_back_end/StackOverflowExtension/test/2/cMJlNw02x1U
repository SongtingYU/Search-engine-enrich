I can us.  The main two things so will start off by going right to the basics okay, so here we have a folder that we want to audit okay and in A.D. eight has a never filed everything within that folder and its subfolders would like to audit, so the first thing is we can set properties.  The security advanced auditing and then basically add the users that you want to we've already added that administrator okay, okay, and then to find click on add accepted and then basically choose that okay we as a consumer oriented case so that's one step.  The second step is to go group policy object plan for that you can go to a server manager okay am from server manager, you basically click on tools okay group policy management that brings the to that window okay wage basically then hands the politics of were just doing a quick demo, so were going into group policy objects for the domain hand default domain policy, right click on that click and don't forget to make sure that it's enforced that just regular that and kick and force that means it active.
