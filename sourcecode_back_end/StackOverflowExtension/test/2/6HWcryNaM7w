In different occasions I met people that were keying monthly or on a regular bases receivable transactions/invoices for same customer having same amount and under same contractual conditions.
Even if is not quite same amount but all the other information (customer, lines details) are similar you can successfully use the Copy To functionality in Oracle eBS Accounts Receivables.
Steps included:
Step 1 - Find the invoice / transaction you want to copy
Step 2 - Copy same invoice using Daily option
Step 3 - Copy same invoice using Monthly option
Step 4 - Copy same invoice using Annually option
Step 5 - Review generated transactions - output file
Step 6 - Review generated transactions - workbench
