In this video I create a symbolic link from a directory I created called public_html in my home directory to the /var/www folder.  I create this so that I do not need to change permissions or ownership to the www directory to write files to it.  The command is sudo ln -s /home/USER/public_html /var/www.  I then test a web page in the link folder using firefox. For more information visit http://lecturesnippets.com
