In this video I will show you how to easily move your entire WordPress site over to a new host. This is handy if you build websites professionally and need to build them on a staging server before moving them over to the permanent URL. If you follow this tutorial you will move the ENTIRE website--including all content, pictures, copy, users, passwords, plugins and more.

Hi there! My name is James Hunt and this is my YouTube channel that is dedicated to marketing, web design, SEO and more. Here you will find videos on how to do cool online marketing related things (that I do professionally for an agency and as a freelancer). 

I am the Director of Accounts and Production for a marketing agency out of Dallas that specializes in small business marketing. I also work as a freelancer--mainly building websites and doing SEO work. My goal with this YouTube channel is to teach other people how to be successful in marketing and to teach viewers how to do the things that I do on a regular basis (and make a good amount of money doing it).

Feel free to send me an email with any inquiries related to my YouTube channel or online marketing: info@jameswesleyhunt.com
