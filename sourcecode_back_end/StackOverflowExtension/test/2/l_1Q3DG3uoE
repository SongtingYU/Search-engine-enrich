In this video we move on from the previous video that looked at hard links and inodes to sym -links. These are still links and do show as file type link when we use ls -l. They are, though, a completely separate file. This does mean that as we do not share the same metadata os the original file we link to we can cross file system boundaries. We do take up a small amount of disk space and an entry in the inode table. This, in today's market is not a problem and the benefits of sym-links out shine anything else. they can cross file-system boundaries and can  link to directories.
