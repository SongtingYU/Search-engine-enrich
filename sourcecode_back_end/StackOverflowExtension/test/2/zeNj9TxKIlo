This movie explains how to use the "Session Import Data" functionality of Pro Tools 9. The movie covers importing data from one session, into a brand new one. You will see how a new session is created, and how to deal with transferring Tempo, Time Signature, Markers, Audio Tracks, and other session related data into a new, or consolidated session. Import Session Data has many uses for keeping your sessions tidy, and organized. If you're having a Drum Edit session, or a drum recording session, or a vocal session, it's not necessary to do that work in the actual master session. Try importing only the tracks you need to do the task at hand. Do the work, do the edits, and when finished, fly them back to the original session as finished tracks. Nice!
