The MA in Critical Theory and Creative Research program welcomes Graham Harman, a central figure in Speculative Realism and Object-Oriented Ontology. His talk is titled "Greenberg, Heidegger, McLuhan, and the Arts" and was given at PNCA. Harman is Professor of Philosophy and Associate Provost for Research Administration at the American University in Cairo, Egypt. As part of the speculative realist & object-oriented approach in ontology, he argues that objects aren't reducible to mere bundles of properties or their relations or effects on other things. Instead, objects must be understood as real independent substances in their own right, over and above their manifold sensory qualities. Otherwise, objects lose their underlying identity as something real, and end up being mere appearances, analyzable in terms of something else which is more fundamental and real. This object-oriented approach leads Harman to a pluralistic vision of the world, in contrast to the more holistic and monistic tendency which has characterized much of the traditional and contemporary philosophical debate.
