This video focuses on the importance of conducting a search of existing trademarks before filing your trademark application. It provides a brief overview of (1) the concept of "likelihood of confusion;" (2) the effect of being the first to file; and (3) the USPTO's Trademark Electronic Search System (TESS). It is critical that you conduct a search for conflicting marks before you file, as the existence of a mark that is confusingly similar to yours and used with related goods and/or services may bar registration of your mark.
