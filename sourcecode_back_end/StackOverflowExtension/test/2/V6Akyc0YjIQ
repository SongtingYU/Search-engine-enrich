http://yanhuang.me/2013/02/23/symbolic-link/ - A symbolic link is a file that references to another file in Linux. This is the equivalent of a shortcut file in Windows. In the context of websites, a symbolic link is useful when you have multiple websites that references to a software library or images directory that spans globally across all of the websites. For example, let's say you have 50 websites with a single administrative area that uploads images to a specific location on the server. Instead of copying the images in this folder over to 50 different folders, you can create a symbolic link from each of the website's /images to the global images folder.
