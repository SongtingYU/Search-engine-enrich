In this video, I will show you how to easily create Symbolic Links & Junctions. I will cover Hard Links in a future tutorial.

#NOTE#
In this video, I do NOT show you how to delete symlinks. To do this, all you have to do is right click on the files/folders with either the green arrow (Symbolic Link) or the chain (Junction) and select 'Delete' just as you would with a normal shortcut file. This works exactly the same way for Hard Links.

*WRITTEN Tutorial:

KEY: (For instructions)


##Files## ~ Files-only 

{{Folders}} ~ Folders (containing files)

%%Files & Folders%% ~ instructions required for BOTH files & folders



•%%Cut the files/folders from the original location.%%


•%%Create a new folder (and name it accordingly) in the desired (space-taking) location.%%


%%•Paste the files/folders into that new folder.%%


•{{Go to the original location. Instead of symlinking the folders with the files inside, create the needed (and correctly named) folder/s for the corresponding FILES. The reason for this is that the files inside the folder/s will NOT be symlinked properly if you symlink the FOLDER. If you did that, the files would still take up as much space as they did before you symlinked them.}}


•%%Now highlight all of the FILES (inside the folders if you have folders), right-click and select 'Pick Link Source.'%%


•%%Go to the original location, right-click and select 'Symbolic Link.'%%


({{Do this inside the corresponding folders if you have files associated with them.}})


%%•The symlinks will appear as the original files did with the exception of a green arrow symbol. These 'links' take up no space at all on the drive. However; everything will work exactly as it did before.%%
