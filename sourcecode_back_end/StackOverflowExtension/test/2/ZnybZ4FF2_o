* How to import OS Agents Reports 6.3.0 Fix Pack 2

* How to access the OS agent reports in Tivoli Common Reporting (TCR) 3.1

NOTE: You need to have TCR 3.1 installed in your environment and OS agents reports package downloaded. Requires Reporting Service AND/OR Vizualization Service (DASH) from the Jazz for Service Management  (JazzSM) package.

 - JazzSM 1.1.2.0 for Linux (Part Number - CN54VML)
 - TCR 3.1.2.0 for Linux (Part Number - CN54ZML)
 - OS Agents Reports 6.3.0.2 (Part Number - CIQ3RML)

Link for other operating system packages -                       http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24039873

We successfuly imported the OS Agent Reports in Tivoli Common Reporting. The same procedure can be used for other versions of OS Agent Reports.

- If you only have the Reporting Services installed (No DASH/Vizualization Service) installed from the JazzSM package use the following link to access Tivoli Common Reporting:
http://host.domain:port/tarf/servlet/dispatch

- If you are installing the reports on Windows. Download the reports package. Copy the reports folder "IBM Tivoli Monitoring OS Agents Reports.zip" UNDER C:\AGENT_REPORTS\reports\cognos_reports\osagents TO C:\Program Files\IBM\JazzSM\reporting\cognos\deployment (or the location where JazzSM is installed). Once this is done the import can be initiated.
