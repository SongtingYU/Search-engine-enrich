LYRICS
Wake up in the morning looking greener than Shrek 
Sleeping in a tub can really mess up your neck
Before I leave I stop and vomit up tequilla and glitter
Im spending every morning with my head in the s**tter
Got vomit in my hair
But Im way too sick to care
Now Im fallin down the stairs
I pull myself off the floor
Then Im almost at the door
But my family is waiting for me
Oh crap not again
Its an intervention
Its cool Im fine
I can stop at any time
 
DAD
Thats a lie
You wont try
Now youve made your mother cry  Look!
 
MOM
O o o o O o o o
 
KESHA
Im outta here
This is queer
I just drank a couple beers
 
MOM
Dont leave
We love you
We even hired Dr. Drew
 
DR. DREW
This pattern
needs to end
 
KESHA
I think I have to puke again
O o o o O o o o
 
KESHA
So, I decide to stay, but my head is still reeling
Then they all go down the line talkin bout their feelings
 
BROTHER [reading]
It makes me sad when I see brush your teeth with Jack
Also you borrowed my gold bike and never gave it back
 
DAD
Stop showing off your butt
Youre making young girls act like sluts
And youre starting to get a beer gut
 
DR. DREW
This behavior is a dead end
P. Diddy is not your friend
Youll end up like Lindsay Lohan 
L-L-L-L-Lohan

KESHA 
This is whack
I feel trapped
 
DR. DREW
We just want the old Kesha back
 
KESHA
Screw you
Dr. Drew
And your stupid camera crew
 
MOM
Hey you
dont have to shout
We're just trying to help you out

O o o o  O o o o

KESHA
Okay
Its time you know
This is just a video
I dont drink
Or pee in sinks
Thats just what I want my fans to think
Its all an act
And in fact
Its even in my contract
 
FAMILY
O O O O O O
