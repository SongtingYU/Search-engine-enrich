UPDATED VIDEO WITH MORE INFO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kkp6FIbzeas&feature=youtu.be

An initial critical look at some of the first street footage to hit youtube. This small group of people enter a staged area to give a quick interview while lined up against the fence and then shuffle off somewhere else. I decided to take a closer look because the first street footage from the Oralando Shooting Hoax was very revealing. I think you'll find this scene to be just as remarkable. Please share your thoughts in the comment section and elaborate on some things I failed to mention.
