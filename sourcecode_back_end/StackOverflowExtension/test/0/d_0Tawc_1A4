Antichamber was originally released as a mod for Unreal Tournament 3 in 2009. The core puzzles, mechanics and base themes were all in place. But what worked as a free mod had some serious issues when making the transition to a standalone commercial game. This GDC 2014 Main Conference talk from the game's creator Alex Bruce lays out an in-depth analysis of the several years of refinement that went into turning an abstract experiment into an independent hit.
GDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
