Thanks for watching my Rayman Legends Gameplay and Walkthrough. I'm playing this game on the PS3, but it's also available for the Wii U, PC, Xbox 360, and the Vita. I've never played a Rayman game before, but I like what I've seen so far, and I'm excited to start playing this highly anticipated platformer! You may have seen an E3 trailer or review, but this playthrough will feature my commentary through the entire story mode including the ending! If you're a fan of the Rayman series, then let's play Rayman Legends! Subscribe to ZackScottGames for new episodes of Rayman Legends today!
