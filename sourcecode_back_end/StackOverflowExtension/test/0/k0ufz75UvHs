Hey everyone, this is a video about a method to drawing I've termed "iterative drawing" because it requires you to improve through many iterations of a drawing to gain mileage quickly.  I know people who use this, but so far I don't know anyone who has actually taught it as a method to improve.  Seems to be something 'talented' artists do anyway but don't really teach or explain.  If you're new to this concept, I hope it helps you.

Tools:
Adobe Photoshop CS6
Wacom Cintiq 22HD
Open Broadcaster Software
Audacity
