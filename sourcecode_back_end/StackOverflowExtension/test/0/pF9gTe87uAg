From buying equips from NPCs to making equips for myself.
My journey as a Night Lord was really long.
Soloing bosses to bosses , started with Mano , now with HornTail
This video doesn't really summarize my journey but i can tell you it's a LONG and exciting journey , IPureLukzZ was created in January 2013 now it's 27th of November 2013. My channel was started in 12th of April 2013 now it's 27th of November 2013 , and I'm with 130 subscribers , which is JUST amazing. 

After hitting 100 subscribers , I wanted to hit 120 subscribers at the end of this year.
Now , it's not even the end of the year and I'm with 130!

I would sincerely Thank YOU ALL , every single one of you who liked , disliked and comment this video. Without you I've wouldn't be typing the description now saying that I have 130 subscribers.
