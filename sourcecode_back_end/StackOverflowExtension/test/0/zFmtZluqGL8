So I found something that didn't add up and I wanted to share. Sorry, I get camera shy so I may seem nervous, and whe I mentioned watching old stuff on CNN about old couples, I was referring to Dateline NBC where they host "I married an Axe Murderer", or something like that, they ALWAYS have pics of the ex couple together, but not them?

It also never made sense why if he was abusive, then why never report him or anything.

Also one thing to think about, IF this womans life was private online being no pics show up(Tho I'm not buying it because nothing online is private and google accesses everything) why suddenly would 10-20 different pics pop up in one day, and where did they come from? Think about it folks.

Anyways, tell me what you guy think.
