About Teen Titans GO!: 
TEEN TITANS GO! is a comedy featuring the beloved DC heroes seen in a skewed light. They still fight crime and face classic villains, but mainly deal with all the issues of five teens rooming together -- chores, romantic tension, demon dad drop-ins and impromptu meatball parties.  They also dance! The emphasis is on the odd everyday life of super heroes who haven't grown up.
