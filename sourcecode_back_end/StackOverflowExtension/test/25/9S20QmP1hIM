Baz Luhrmann, The Great Gatsby - Australian director Baz Luhrmann certainly has a knack for giving us lush period pieces that are glorious to watch. His previous films Romeo + Juliet and Moulin Rouge! were visually stunning and we can expect nothing less from his latest effort The Great Gatsby, based on F.Scott Fitzgerald's classic novel.

The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Jay Gatsby, Tobey Maguire as narrator Nick Carraway, Carey Mulligan as golden girl Daisy Buchanan, and newcomer Elizabeth Debicki as bad girl Jordan Baker.

Tribute.ca had the opportunity to speak with Baz about bringing his vision of the Jazz Age to the big screen, working with his incredible cast and his upcoming stage adaptation of his hit film Strictly Ballroom.

The Great Gatsby movie synopsis:

Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire), a young man from Minnesota, moves to New York to learn about the bond business. He rents a house in the swanky West Egg district of Long Island. He eventually meets his neighbor Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio) and gets caught up in his world of extravagant parties and people.

Based on the novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald, this story deals with the allure of fame and fortune, as well as the unbreakable bond of first love.

Starring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, Carey Mulligan, Joel Edgerton, Isla Fisher, Jason Clarke, Elizabeth Debicki, Amitabh Bachchan
