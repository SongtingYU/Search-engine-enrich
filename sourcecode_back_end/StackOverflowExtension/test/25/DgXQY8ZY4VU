This tutorial covers how to create unordered lists in HTML. An unordered list is a list that uses "bullet points" to list items, rather than numbers.

We also talk about how to put lists within other lists, or nesting, creating a "sub-list", which can be useful for a variety of different things.

If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, please feel free to contact me and let me know!

Thank you for watching!
