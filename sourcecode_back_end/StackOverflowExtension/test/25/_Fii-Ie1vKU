31 "No Foo-Foo" Chicken Recipes - Delicious, Family Friendly Chicken Recipes For Everyday REAL People - Volume I (31 "No Foo-Foo" Recipes)

What&#039;s for dinner tonight? It&#039;s a question most of us dread
Because we truly want to give our family and friends something that they enjoy, that is relatively quick, easy and budget friendly as well.More often than not...there&#039;s a good chance your answer will be chicken &mdash; since it is the number one meat consumed by Americans
The conundrum comes because we really desire to change up our chicken recipe repertoire..
so that it&#039;s not the &quot;same ole same ole&quot;
We want to have a variety of chicken meals to serve our family and friends.If you are like me, you&#039;ve probably purchased many cookbooks over the years, trying to find new chicken recipe ideas to feed your family.Usually though (to your dismay), you find that you end up only being able to (or even wanting to) use 3-4 of the chicken recipes in the whole cookbook.Reason...because most chicken recipe cookbooks are full of &quot;fancy&quot;, &quot;foo-foo&quot; chicken recipes that very few REAL people actually enjoy and/or want to go thru the expense and hassle of cooking.So after years of using my family and friends as my &quot;guinea pigs&quot;, and trying out hundreds of different chicken recipes, I&#039;ve finally put together some of our favorite, family friendly, relatively inexpensive, delicious chicken recipes - that you can be proud to serve to your family and friends!This is how the &quot;No Foo-Foo&quot; Series of Cookbooks was hatched.Delicious Chicken Recipes in Volume I include:-Grilled Chicken Recipes-Baked Chicken Recipes-Fried Chicken Recipes-Chicken Enchilada Recipes-Chicken Parmesan Recipes-Chicken Fajita Recipes-Chicken Strip Recipes-&quot;Mexican&quot; Chicken Recipes-Chicken Casserole Recipes-Chicken &quot;Dump&quot; Recipes-And Many More Yummy Quick and Easy Chicken Recipes31 Easy, Delicious Chicken Recipes...One for every night of the month
But that&#039;s not all...I&#039;ve also included several BONUS recipes that I know you are going to love.I hope you, your family and friends enjoy these chicken recipes as much as we have.
