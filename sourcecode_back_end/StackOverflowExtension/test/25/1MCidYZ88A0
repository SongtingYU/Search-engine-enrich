This video, like the two previous HTML tutorial videos, explains what definition lists are and how they can be used, as well as how to create them in HTML.

Definition lists are different from ordered and unordered lists, in that they are used to list items or topics and then define them underneath. This can be useful for defining words, describing who people or things are, etc.

Thank you for watching!
