While you may have guessed that some countries, like China, do a very interesting job of translating movie titles, they are not a alone. Many countries do impressive acrobatics with the wording of their titles when they are translating them from English. Why? Well, there are many reasons for this, but one of them is that quite often countries don't actually know what the movie is about until it is actually released. But...they have to start advertising long before that. This means that they translate the name as best as they can but it often happens that the name was figurative in some way. This very obviously can lead to a misleading or comical movie title. Of course, this doesn't typically bother movie goers, and many of these titles become something of a joke among the multi-lingual crowd. And for this reason, we are going to share them with you. If you are from these countries, you probably already know about some of these titles but there are sure to be a few that bring a smile to your face. So get ready to try figuring out what on Earth they were thinking when you read about these 25 countries that did a very strange job of translating movie titles!
