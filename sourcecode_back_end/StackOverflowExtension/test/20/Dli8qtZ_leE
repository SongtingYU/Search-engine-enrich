LYRICS:

Just in case I don't make it home tonight
Let me make love to you for the last time, baby
Wanna cherish each moment like the last
Cause baby you're all that I have
So just in case

Think of how we made love almost anywhere
Haven't I taken you almost everywhere
Think of all the things that, that we shared
Then imagine me not there, oh

Giving you more karats than a rabbit
Got you living lavish
Anything I've got, you can have it
Baby I'll do magic
I'll do all I can, to keep you satisfied
So just in case I don't make it home tonight, baby

Repeat 1 (2x)

Haven't I made you feel so special
As your man I've held your hand
Never letting go
Let you hold the keys to the Lex, huh to drive
Give you all you need and more as long as I'm alive

Even from the heavens up above
I'll shine all around
Too much is never enough
Ooh you are all I want
Even when I'm gone, my love will carry on
It's just that strong
So just in case

Repeat 1 (2x)

Baby you know I love you
More than anything in this whole world
You're my anything, my everything
My wife, my queen
So if something happens to me
There's something you need to know................................ oh

Repeat 1 untill end
