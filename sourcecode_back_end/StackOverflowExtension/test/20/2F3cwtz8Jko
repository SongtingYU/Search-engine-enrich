Ryan Lochte may be back on American soil, but Rio isn't done with him just yet. A judge recently denied the Olympic swimmer's request to dismiss his fake robbery case, in which he filed a false police report alleging he and members from the U.S. swim team were robbed at gunpoint after a night out partying.

The Rio judge not only denied the request, but moved Lochte's case up to a higher court to the public Ministry of Justice, according to TMZ. The Ministry will now begin to determine how large of a fine they will slap the 12-time Olympic medalist with. The court is reportedly looking to serve Lochte with a fine north of the $11K, which would be more than Lochte teammate's Jimmy Feigen was given.
