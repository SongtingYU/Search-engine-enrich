A woman went to the hospital with what she thought was a painful kidney stone, but ended up passing something much bigger. When Stephanie Jaegers told the doctors she was having abdominal pain, they performed an ultrasound and found out what was really happening. She was 38 weeks pregnant and in labor! She almost didn't believe them. She had been pregnant 3 times before and did not have the normal signs of pregnancy, but, that same day baby Shaun was born.
