How Many Languages does Nerdfighteria Speak? Let's find out! http://nerdfighteria.vanillaforums.com/discussion/2043/how-many-languages-does-nerdfighteria-speak

In which Hank (with the help of Irina, Amy, Florencia, Daniel, David, James, and Kensaku) translates songs that have spawned dance crazes in America, but I primarily not in English. 

I learned a lot more about these songs than I was able to fit in this video, I apologize for not being able to share more. Maybe I'll put some extra stuff on hankschannel.

Thanks to Michael Aranda for the mixes: http://www.youtube.com/michaelaranda
