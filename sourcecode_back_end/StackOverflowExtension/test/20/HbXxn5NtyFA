I picked up this Yellow Jacket Stun Gun iPhone 7 case and was like this is so nuts! I’m lowkey pretty scared in this video and I stun myself with the iPhone. The case is actually really cool and there’s new ones coming out for the new iPhone soon! This is a crazy and amazing invention that we gotta have on our iPhones!
