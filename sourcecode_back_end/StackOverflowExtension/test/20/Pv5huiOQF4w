Welcome to Mezaa. This is an island on a planet called Novi. On this Island there are two packs, the ForestPack and the SandPack. They have never gotten along and tension has crackled between the packs for generations. Seperated by the HeartStone, the sheild from the evil DarkOnes that could take over Mezaa, the two packs live as their owns. The ForestPack, loyal but timid, hardly starting fights, and the SandPack, always too proud and feirce to let themselves get put down. 
Which pack are you?
