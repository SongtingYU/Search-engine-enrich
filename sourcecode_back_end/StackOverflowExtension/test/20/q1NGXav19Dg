Easy video tutorial of how to decorate phone cases and make them custom and cute! In this video I show how to make Slime Phone Case, Pusheen Phone Case, 3D Piano Phone Case, World Map and Studded Phone Cases. 

First DIY Phone Cover is a Studded Phone Case. And what is really amazing about it is that you will not need studs! Just thumb tacks and super glue.

Next is super cute DIY Pusheen Phone Case. I love this cat very much and it is really fun to have it in your purse as a phone case. Prepare acrylic paints (light grey, dark grey and brown) and pieces of felt for ears and tail (optional).

The third phone case is a Piano Keyboard. You'll need popsicle sticks, black and white acrylic paints and a strong glue. I'm sure you will fall in love with this phone case design! 

DIY Slime Phone Case â€“ is really easy to make. All you need is a glue gun and neon nail polishes. Actually you can make this slime cover with any colors. Make it as a galaxy slime with glitter even!

And the last one is a DIY World Map Phone case. I really love it, cause I love our planet so much! It makes me feel as Indiana Jones :) I used printed images, but you can use a real useless map and postage stamps.
