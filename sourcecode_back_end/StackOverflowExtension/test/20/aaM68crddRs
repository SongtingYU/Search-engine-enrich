The modern world that we live in perpetually bombards us with situations that cause stress. A certain amount is good for us, but overmuch - particularly if it's day in and day out - may cause us both emotional and physical troubles.   

However, there's a really simple, cheap and very effective answer - music. Music is an awesome healer. It is so powerful that relaxation music is utilized by hospitals across the world to reduce anxiousness in patients who are about to go into surgery. It has the power to comfort and relax you, to change your whole mood, and increase your energy state.  

Frequently, music therapy is more cost-effective than administering medication, particularly for patients with anxiety, sleep disturbances or pain. Listening to music with a pace of 60 bpm has the most health benefits. This is the optimum rate for a resting heart, and you'll find that when you listen to music of this tempo your breathing will slow in time to the music. This successively will slow your pulse, promoting a calm, meditative state.  

With all the ways music affects your body, you are able to likely already clearly see how music may be utilized as an effective relaxation and stress management tool. In addition to the many physical changes that music may bring, music is particularly helpful in relaxation and stress management as it may be used in the following ways: 

Music and Physical Relaxation: Music may promote relaxation of tense muscles, enabling you to easily release some of the tension you bear from a stressful day (or week).  

Music as an Aid in Stress Relief actions: Music may help you get ‘into the zone’ when practicing yoga, self hypnosis or guided imagery, may help you feel energized when exercising, help dissolve the stress when you’re soaking in the tub, and be a helpful part of a lot of other stress relief activities. It may take an effective stress reliever and make it even more effective!  

Music and a Meditative State: As mentioned earlier, music may help your brain get into a meditative state, which carries wonderful stress relief advantages with it. For those who find meditation intimidating, music may be an easier alternative.  

Music to Promote a Positive Focus: Music, particularly upbeat tunes, may take your mind off what stresses you, and help you feel more optimistic and positive. This helps expel stress and may even help you keep from getting as stressed over life’s little frustrations in the future.  

Music and Affirmations: The way you see the world and the type of self-talk you routinely utilize may also have a profound effect on your stress level, which is why positive affirmations that produce more positive self talk are so helpful. Music that has affirming lyrics may bring the double benefit of music and positive affirmations, helping you to surround yourself with positive energy and more frequently look on the bright side, letting stressful events more easily roll off your back.
