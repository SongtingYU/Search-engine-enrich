A quick run through a Timed Mode match from our upcoming, mobile game Vex Blocks.  This game is in development with Unity3d.  Of note, this video was captured on the PC, so game features like screen rotation were not displayed.  See more at http://itzyinteractive.com/vexblocks/.  Release is slated for early 2013.
