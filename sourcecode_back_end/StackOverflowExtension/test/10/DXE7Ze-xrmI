Cad Chaos is general is a YouTube channel where I guide the viewer through my latest solidworks projects. Also many of the videos are in a tutorial setting where I try my hardest to clearly explain to the viewer exactly how the tool or process works. Some times we cover just a simple feature, but then again maybe we focus on a larger picture like working with surfaces. in general the goal here is not only to become more skilled at using SolidWorks, but having some fun as well. Enjoy!
