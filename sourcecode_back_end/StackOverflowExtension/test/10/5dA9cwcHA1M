In this video, Spence shows you how easy it can be to modify the look and feel of your WordPress footer without being an expert in PHP!

With a few simple tricks, you can learn how to quickly and easily change the date of any site in the copyright division, to modify the title of the site displayed, or to even customize the "powered-by" division.

No longer do you have to feel that you are trapped by whatever the theme author included by default, because with just a little copy/paste you can do whatever you want for yourself or your client. 

Best of all, you will learn "just enough" about PHP to be able to replicate this again and again on different parts of your WordPress sites. Like working with Lego blocks, this is "modular" and can be repeated over and over, even if you are just starting out with PHP.
