His personal residence was feature in a cover article on the world’s largest renewable energy magazine, Home Power. He owns a large “wildlife preserve” next to Lake Shasta in northern California.

Dane put all his focus, efforts and energy on the geoengineering issue when he began to lose very significant amounts of solar uptake due to the ever-increasing “solar obscuration” caused from jet aircraft spraying in the skies above his forest home. He also noted significant decline in forest health was occurring and appeared to be accelerating. Extensive testing and research into the geoengineering issue was commenced and has continued since 2002.

He is the lead researcher for  HYPERLINK "http://www.geoengineeringwatch.org" www.geoengineeringwatch.org and has investigated all levels of geo engineering from stratospheric aerosol geoengineering (SAG) to HAARP.  He has appeared numerous films, and radio interviews to educate the public on the extremely dire environmental and health dangers we face on a global level from geoengineering.

Dane lives in Shasta County, California.
