The second alpha for my video game. This is the result of going 3D. Once I started working on the zombies, it was hard to reconcile the idea of the characters being in cutesy proportions and trying to make them scary, so I went back to the drawing board to rethink things. I was also unhappy with the animation seeming weird.

This game is probably going to be completely redone from the ground up after DRET and Vega Rift.
