Welcome to another python 3 basics video, in this video we're going to now discuss the concept of global and local variables.

When users begin using functions, they can quickly become confused when it comes to global and local variables... getting a the dreaded variable is not defined even when they clearly see that it is... or so they think.

These terms of global and local correspond to a variable's reach within a script or program. A global variable is one that can be accessed anywhere. A local variable is the opposite, it can only be accessed within its frame. The difference is that global variables can be accessed locally, but not modified locally inherently.

A local variable cannot be accessed globally, inherently. Now, dont worry about committing that to memory right now, I think it makes a lot more sense when you just see and do it, so let's do that.
