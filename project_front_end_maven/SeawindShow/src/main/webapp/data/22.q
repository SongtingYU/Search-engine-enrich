<p>We are working on an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S60_%28software_platform%29">S60</a> version and this platform has a nice Python API. </p>

<p>However, there is nothing official about Python on Android, but since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jython">Jython</a> exists, is there a way to let the snake and the robot work together?</p>
