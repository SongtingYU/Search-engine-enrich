Look at the subprocess module in the stdlib: from subprocess import call call(['ls', '-l']) The advantage of subprocess vs system is that it is more flexible (you can get the stdout, stderr, the 'real' status code, better error handling, etc...). I think os.system is deprecated, too, or will be: https://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html#replacing-older-functions-with-the-subprocess-module For quick/dirty/one time scripts, os.system is enough, though.
