<p>You can use a global variable in other functions by declaring it as <code>global</code> in each function that assigns to it:</p>

<pre><code>globvar = 0

def set_globvar_to_one():
    global globvar    # Needed to modify global copy of globvar
    globvar = 1

def print_globvar():
    print globvar     # No need for global declaration to read value of globvar

set_globvar_to_one()
print_globvar()       # Prints 1
</code></pre>

<p>I imagine the reason for it is that, since global variables are so dangerous, Python wants to make sure that you really know that's what you're playing with by explicitly requiring the <code>global</code> keyword.</p>

<p>See other answers if you want to share a global variable across modules.</p>
