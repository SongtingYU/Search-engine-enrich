<p>I wanted to test if a key exists in a dictionary before updating the value for the key.
I wrote the following code:</p>

<pre><code>if 'key1' in dict.keys():
  print "blah"
else:
  print "boo"
</code></pre>

<p>I think this is not the best way to accomplish this task. Is there a better way to test for a key in the dictionary?</p>
