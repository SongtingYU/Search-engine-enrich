os.listdir() will get you everything that's in a directory - files and directories. If you want just files, you could either filter this down using os.path: from os import listdir from os.path import isfile, join onlyfiles = [f for f in listdir(mypath) if isfile(join(mypath, f))] or you could use os.walk() which will yield two lists for each directory it visits - splitting into files and dirs for you. If you only want the top directory you can just break the first time it yields from os import walk f = [] for (dirpath, dirnames, filenames) in walk(mypath): f.extend(filenames) break And lastly, as that example shows, adding one list to another you can either use .extend() or >;>;>; q = [1, 2, 3] >;>;>; w = [4, 5, 6] >;>;>; q = q + w >;>;>; q [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] Personally, I prefer .extend()
